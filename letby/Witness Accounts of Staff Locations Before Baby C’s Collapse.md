## Summary:
- **Sophie Ellis** only documented _Melanie Taylor_ in her contemporaneous notes. In 2018 she added _Lucy Letby_ in her police statement. 
	- She said she briefly left for the nurses’ station, heard the alarm, and returned. 
	-  For that first desaturation, she found **Lucy Letby** by the incubator.
	- After it resolved, Ellis stayed in the room but sat at the **computer**, which faced the wall near Baby C’s cot about 1-2m away.
	- She described **two incidents**, saying Letby was there for both, though her notes show **three**.
- **Melanie Taylor’s 2018 police statement** said she was **already in nursery 1**, and that **Sophie Ellis called her over**. She said **only she and Ellis** were at the cot using the Neopuff and inserting the Guedel airway. In court years later, she changed this to say **Letby was already there** and suggested using the airway.
- **Nurse B** was consistent from police statement to trial: she entered on a call for help, saw **Ellis and Taylor** ventilating the baby, and said **Letby arrived later** from nursery 3. Also suggests she was likely also occupied in Nursery 3.
- **Police conduct:** when Letby was interviewed the 2nd time, they already had statements from Taylor and Nurse B saying she wasn’t initially present. They **withheld those statements and falsely told her** that Ellis had recorded her as being the only nurse in the room.
- **Letby’s recall:** at that interview she said she **couldn’t remember** where she was. Later, once she’d been shown fuller evidence she said she **recalled being called in later**, consistent with Taylor’s and Nurse B’s original accounts.
- **Timing:** only about six minutes between Letby’s last text (23:09) and the baby’s collapse (23:15), leaving little room for all 3 events.
- **No witness evidence** supports any claim of an inflated or distended abdomen.
- **No contemporaneous notes** show Letby's presence, only Taylor and Ellis.

Floor plan and cot of Baby C.

I have real the entire transcript with respect to Baby C. This post covers the full testimony record on the personnel locations; reading it gives you the same picture the jury had of the witness evidence.
### Sophie Ellis
>**Q.** It says: "Myself [that's you] asked Registrar Katherine Davis to start trophic feeds and she agreed."  
**A.** Yes.  
**Q.** "Started on 0.5ml, two-hourly." That's 0.5ml of?  
**A.** Expressed breast milk.  
**Q.** Thank you. It says the first feed of 0.5ml was given at 23.00; yes?  
**A.** Yes.  
**Q.** "At around 23.15 [Baby C] had an apnoeic episode with prolonged brady and desat." Could you explain that to us, please?  
**A.** Yes. So I don't know whether this is in my notes, but the first desaturation that he had, I wasn't in the room, so I'd left the room and I heard that he'd had a desaturation because his monitor went off. So I re-entered the room.  
**Q.** This is at 11.15?  
**A.** Possibly.  
**Q.** Okay. I'm going to come back to 11.15 in a minute because there's a couple of things I'd like just to ask you about before that stage. If we leave that note now, please, and we'll come back to it in a moment. If we go, please, to 169, but don't go behind the tile straightaway, please. I want to fast forward to 11 o'clock. Can you just tell us, please, what you can remember of the shift from that first period when you came on? You checked the observations, you did all your equipment checks. Do you remember what time, for example, you had the conversation with Dr Davis about the trophic feeds?  
**A.** I don't remember the exact time, whether it was maybe shortly before 11 o'clock. I can't remember the exact time, but from my statement, I gave him 0.5ml of EBM at 11 o'clock.  
**Q.** Okay. Anything you can recall between coming on duty at 8 o'clock and that incident around 11 that you've started to describe in your notes?  
**A.** Before 11 o'clock?  
**Q.** Yes, so the period between 8 and 11 o'clock. Does anything stand out during the course of your care for [Baby C] over that period?  
**A.** There was nothing particularly striking. He was doing well, he'd just come off his CPAP on to high flow. He was a feisty little baby. But yeah, he was doing well.  
**Q.** What do you mean by feisty?  
**A.** He was just very active.  
**Q.** Okay. Could we go next, please, to 182, Mr Murphy, rather than opening 169 at this stage? If we can go behind that note, please. If we can look at that in the original, please. It's the bottom left, please, that entry in the bottom left. This is another retrospective note?  
**A.** Yes.  
**Q.** It says: "Had two times fleeting bradys, self-correcting, not needing any intervention, shortly before prolonged brady and apnoea requiring resus." I think you started to tell us about an incident when you were out of the room.  
**A.** Yes.  
**Q.** Is this the incident that you were talking about or is this something different?  
**A.** That's the incident.  
**Q.** I'm sorry to cut across you. I just wanted to make sure we got this in the right order. So tell us then about that first incident involving the two fleeting bradycardias, is that --  
**A.** Yes.  
**Q.** -- which were ultimately self-correcting.  
**A.** I'm not sure when the first one was, but I know one of those fleeting or one of those bradycardias and desaturations -- once I'd -- I'd given [Baby C] his 0.5ml of milk, I don't know the exact time frame after that, it wasn't immediately afterwards -- again, I'm not quite sure of the exact time frame. I left the room and then shortly after me leaving the room, the monitor alarmed so I re-entered the room, and Lucy had said, "He's just had a brady and a desat", or something along those lines --  
**MR JUSTICE GOSS:**  
**A.** Can we take this a little bit slower? Sorry.  
**MR ASTBURY:** So you were out of the room. Do you remember where you had gone?  
**A.** I had literally just gone to the nursing station, which was just round the corner.  
**Q.** Okay. You heard the alarm go off you told us?  
**A.** Yes.  
**Q.** All right. Anything significant in the alarm? Did it tell you anything in itself?  
**A.** As in what type of alarm it was?  
**Q.** Mm. Did it --  
**A.** I can't remember the exact type of alarm, whether it was, you know, a lower level or a higher level.  
**Q.** You guessed my next question. What are the levels, there are two?  
**A.** Yes. There's a more -- for your more, not as -- your more maybe minor desaturations it wouldn't be -- it would just be a lower level alarm. And then when it's a more dramatic desaturation, then it would alarm more frequently.  
**Q.** So there's two levels, one more urgent than the other?  
**A.** Yes.  
**Q.** Did you say yellow and red?  
**A.** A yellow and a red alarm.  
**Q.** So you heard the alarm, you went into the nursery?  
**A.** Yes.  
**Q.** What did you see when you went into the nursery?  
**A.** So I'd seen Lucy standing by the incubator.  
**Q.** Yes? Can you say how long you'd been out of the room?  
**A.** No. It wasn't long, but no, I don't know the exact time.  
**Q.** Are you able to say how long there was between you going out of the room and you hearing the alarm?  
**A.** Again, no, but it wasn't very long. Again, I don't know the exact time.  
**Q.** So you left, you weren't out for very long, and not very long after you hear the alarm?  
**A.** Yes.  
**Q.** And you go back in. Tell us what you see when you go back in.  
**A.** When I went back in the room I saw Lucy standing at the incubator.  
**Q.** Right. Whose incubator?  
**A.** [Baby C]'s.  
**Q.** Right. What, if anything, did she say or do?  
**A.** She said, "He's just had a brady and a desaturation", and I can't remember what she was doing at that time.  
**Q.** Okay. What happened after you'd gone in and you'd found what you found?  
**A.** So after that, the brady and the desat resolved quite quickly, so I then stayed in the nursery, and opposite where [Baby C] was, there was a computer, and I was sat at that computer -- and again, I don't know the exact time frame between the first desaturation and brady to the one that led to the resus --  
**Q.** Can we break that down again? I'm sorry.  
**A.** Sorry.  
**Q.** Did anyone have to do anything -- that first incident with [Baby C], did anyone have to intervene, did anything happen with [Baby C]?  
**A.** When I came into the room, no. I don't know whether anything was done prior to me getting in the room.  
**Q.** Okay.  
**MR JUSTICE GOSS:** So you didn't do anything and you didn't see anything being done to [Baby C]?  
**A.** No.  
**MR ASTBURY:** Did it require any intervention was probably the real question?  
**A.** From memory I can't remember.  
**Q.** Okay.  
**A.** Yes.  
**Q.** Whereabouts in the room is the computer?  
**A.** It was just in front of the bed space where [Baby C] was.  
**Q.** Are we still talking in the left-hand side of nursery 1?  
**A.** Yes.  
**Q.** Where was it positioned in relation to the nursery?  
**A.** It was facing -- it was against a wall and it was facing the wall.  
**Q.** So you go to the computer that's in the room?  
**A.** Okay.  
**Q.** And then [Baby C] was behind. So from where you were at the computer, do we take it if [Baby C]'s behind you couldn't see him at that point?  
**A.** I wouldn't have been able to see him. I don't know how I was sat, whether I was sat on the side or with my back completely to him.  
**Q.** You couldn't see his incubator with what you were doing?  
**A.** Not all of the time that I was sat there, no.  
**Q.** Do you remember what you were doing at the nurses' station?  
**A.** No.  
**Q.** Was anyone else in the nursery still with you when you went to the computer?  
**A.** Lucy was in there. I don't know about anybody else.  
**Q.** Okay. So what happened when you were sitting at the computer?  
**A.** So when I was sat at the computer, he then had a further desaturation and bradycardia and an apnoea, which he didn't resolve, so that's when we had to intervene.  
**Q.** You're at the computer, you're close by. What did you see when you turned round that time?  
**A.** When I turned round I would have seen that he was having a bradycardia and a desaturation. And then I was asked -- again, this is just from looking at my notes, I don't remember this -- [Nurse B] had asked me to go and put out a crash call.  
**Q.** We'll come to your notes in a minute, I'm just keen to know what you can remember first. So when you turn round that second time, did you see anyone else in the room?  
**A.** Lucy was stood at the incubator.  
**Q.** Okay. Can you remember which side of the incubator, how close she was to the incubator?  
**A.** It was -- so it would have been, looking from the computer, it was on the right-hand side.  
**Q.** Okay. You told us about having given [Baby C] that first feed.  
**A.** Yes.  
**Q.** At what time?  
**A.** 11.  
**Q.** Okay. When you'd given him that feed, had you -- we have heard how it happens. Had you aspirated the tube before you fed him?  
**A.** Yes.  
**Q.** What had you found?  
**A.** Some very light-green bile.  
**Q.** Anything else?  
**A.** No.  
**Q.** How long after that feed can you say was that first bradycardia when you were out of the room and came in?  
**A.** It wasn't immediately, but I don't know the exact time.  
**Q.** Okay. So tell us then, on the occasion of the second bradycardia, what you did? Did you leave the computer?  
**A.** Yes.  
**Q.** What did you do?  
**A.** So [Nurse B] asked me to go and put out the crash call, which I did, so I left the nursery to do that.  
**Q.** Where was [Nurse B]?  
**A.** I don't know where she was in the room, but she was in the room at that point.  
**Q.** Right. Are you able to say when she'd come into the room?  
**A.** No.  
**Q.** So [Nurse B] asked you to go and put out a crash call?  
**A.** Yes.  
**Q.** And we've heard that's really summoning help from medical staff?  
**A.** Yes.  
**Q.** So presumably you had to leave the room to do that?  
**A.** Yes.  
**Q.** Do you know how long you were gone?  
**A.** No, but not long.  
**Q.** And did you come back to the room?  
**A.** Yes.  
**Q.** What did you find when you came back to the room?  
**A.** When I re-entered the room, [Nurse B] was going to prepare the drugs, so [Nurse B] asked me to take over chest compressions.  
**Q.** So presumably, they'd already started while you'd been out of the room?  
**A.** Yes, [Nurse B] had started those, yes.  
**Q.** Had they started before you left the room? I should be clear.  
**A.** I don't know.  
**Q.** Right. Who else was at the cot side when you came back?  
**A.** Lucy. I don't know who else.  
**Q.** Do you remember what Lucy was doing?  
**A.** No.  
**Q.** So [Nurse B] asked you to take over the chest compressions?  
**A.** Yes.  
**Q.** Did you do so?  
**A.** Yes.  
**Q.** How long do you think you carried out those chest compressions?  
**A.** I don't know.  
**Q.** Did others arrive?  
**A.** The medical team arrived shortly after putting the crash call out.  
**Q.** And who did that -- who comprised the medical team?  
**A.** It was the registrar, so Katherine Davis. I don't know who else from memory. And Dr Gibbs would have arrived at some point.  
**Q.** Did he arrive the same time or later, can you remember?  
**A.** I don't know.  
**Q.** All right. What, if anything, did Dr Davis do?  
**A.** Again, from looking at my statement, she took over the airway. I don't know who had the airway at that time before she arrived. But yes, she took over the airway.  
**Q.** Did anyone try to contact [Baby C]'s parents?  
**A.** Yes. Again, from looking at my statement, I think one of the nursery nurses, possibly, rang up to the postnatal ward just to inform mum of what was going on.  
**Q.** Did you stay with the chest compressions during the course of the resuscitation that followed?  
**A.** No. So when mum entered the room, I just got upset. It was the first time I'd ever been involved in that situation and it was just completely overwhelming, it was very sudden, very unexpected, so yeah, I did get a little bit upset. Lucy was stood opposite me and said, "Do you want me to take over", I said yes and I left the room and I didn't re-enter the room after that.  
**Q.** What did you do after that?  
**A.** I just took a minute, just to sort myself out, and went to look after some of the babies in nursery 2.  
**Q.** All right. If we go back, please, to tile 184. If we can look at the notes, please. If we can look at the note that's halfway up, please, on the left-hand side, just to complete that note which I came away from. We can see there, just going back to the chronology of events, we've got: "First feed of 0.5ml given at 11.00."  
**A.** Yes.  
**Q.** "At around 23.15, [Baby C] had an apnoeic episode with prolonged brady and desat. Crash call for neonatal team put out by myself."  
**A.** Yes.  
**Q.** That doesn't mention the first of the desats that you have told us about.  
**A.** No.  
**Q.** That would have been, would it, on what you told us, between 11.00 and 11.15?  
**A.** Yes.  
**Q.** "Resuscitation commenced. Resus drugs given as charted; please see medical notes." And then: "Care handed over to SN Mel Taylor."  
**A.** Yes.  
**Q.** You told us that Mel was there for you if you needed her that particular night?  
**A.** Yes.  
**Q.** All right. So when you say "care handed over to Mel Taylor", what would that involve?  
**A.** So she took over the care for [Baby C] at that time.  
**Q.** Okay. I think you told us that you didn't play any further part in [Baby C]'s resuscitation?  
**A.** No.  

##### Cross-exam:

> **Q.** Yes. If you are looking after a baby in the intensive care room, can you leave them on their own, can you just go off and leave them?  
> **A.** I didn't leave him, there was a nurse in there. He was never on his own from recollection.
> **Q.** There was a nurse in there?  
> **A.** Yes, it might not have been me, but there was a nurse --
> **Q.** You haven't told us about that yet. So can I ask you, which nurse is in there if you went out and left him?  
> **A.** When I left him Lucy was in there.
> **Q.** Anyone else?  
> **A.** I don't know.
> **Q.** Tell us about Mel Taylor; was she in there?  
> **A.** Yes, possibly.
> **Q.** We'll come to Lucy in a moment. Mel Taylor was the nurse working in that room with you, wasn't she?  
> **A.** Yes.

> **Q.** On handover. Just so I can be quite clear, you have described two particular incidents after the feeding. The first one you say you fed him, you left the nursery, this is what you say, the alarm went off, and you came back to find Lucy was there who said, "He's had a brady and a desaturation"?  
> **A.** Yes.  
> **Q.** Are you clear that's what she said?  
> **A.** From my statement, yes.  
> **Q.** Your statement's dated 18 January 2018, isn't it?  
> **A.** Yes.  
> **Q.** That's a statement you made after the police had had a witness interview with you; is that correct?  
> **A.** Yes.  
> **Q.** And it's in that statement that you talk about Lucy Letby being there when you came back, isn't it?  
> **A.** Yes.  
> **Q.** There's certainly nothing in the notes that indicates Lucy was present at any time, is there, at any time that you're describing now?  
> **A.** No, not from my medical notes.  
> **Q.** That's a detail, just to be clear, you gave to the police about 3 years later, isn't it?  
> **A.** Yes.  
> **Q.** At a time there was an investigation going on; yes?  
> **A.** Yes.  
> **Q.** And at a time that you knew Lucy Letby was being named; yes?  
> **A.** Yes.  
> **Q.** Yes. Let's carry on. So the first incident is that. As it happens, the notes, we'll look at them in a minute, but we might be able to remember, they say the first incident was two fleeting bradys.  
> **A.** Yes.  
> **Q.** It might be a small thing but you said Lucy said, "He's had a brady and a desaturation". 
> **A.** Yes.  
> **Q.** How do you come to say two fleeting bradys if she said a brady?  
> **A.** He might have had one prior to that event possibly but again I can't remember.  
> **Q.** Can't remember?  
> **A.** Preterm babies are prone to having --  
> **Q.** Pardon?  
> **A.** Preterm babies can have bradycardias and desaturations.  
> **Q.** Then there's a second event some minutes later, you say, after you got back. I am just going through what you say at the moment, Miss Ellis. And you say you're sitting at your computer and Lucy was there and there was a more serious desaturation and brady?  
> **A.** Yes.  
> **Q.** And where was Mel Taylor during all of that part of it?  
> **A.** I don't know.  
> **Q.** Can you help us with whether she was there?  
> **A.** I don't know whether she was there or not.  
> **Q.** Mm. One thing, do you agree, that you would not have done is to leave [Baby C] alone in intensive care at any time?  
> **A.** He wasn't on his own, he was with a more experienced nurse than me in the room.  
> **Q.** At the time that there was any collapse with [Baby C] I'm going to suggest to you that Mel Taylor was present. Do you agree or disagree?  
> **A.** I don't know.  
> **Q.** The first incident, as you describe it to us, doesn't involve Lucy Letby being there at all, does it, Miss Ellis? I am disagreeing with you if it is not clear.  
> **A.** Which episode is that, sorry?  
> **Q.** The one where you say there were two bradys and they were self-correcting.  
> **A.** Yes. So one of them -- I mention that he'd had two prior to the serious episode. I don't know where Lucy was in the first one. I don't know.  
> **Q.** Hang on, can you repeat that, please?  
> **A.** So prior to the significant apnoea where [Baby C] deteriorated, so there was -- I'd said in my notes that he had two prior to that episode. One of them Lucy was in the room. The first one I don't know where -- when that was.  
> **Q.** So are you saying the first one she was there, the second one she wasn't of those?  
> **A.** So she was there for the one prior to the serious one.  
> **Q.** That's what I thought you'd said and I'm making it clear to you, I'm suggesting to you she wasn't there at all at that point.  
> **A.** You say she was. She if was there -- when I re-entered the room, she was there, and then he picked himself back up. And then when I was in the room, when he deteriorated, the serious deterioration, she was possibly also there. But I don't know about the other episode that --  
> **Q.** Can we look at 1950, your notes there. Look at the first one, the large one. Page 1950. Down towards the last few lines, "First feed". It starts with: "First feed at 0.5ml given at 23.00. At around 23.15 [Baby C] had an apnoeic episode with prolonged bradycardia and desaturation." And it goes into the crash call; yes?  
> **A.** Yes.  
> **Q.** That's what you wrote then. Certainly at that point no reference to anything earlier, was there?  
> **A.** No.  
> **Q.** No. You write about what you're saying is the earlier incident, two bradys. We can see that at the bottom can't we --  
> **A.** Yes.  
> **Q.** -- 07.38?  
> **A.** Yes.  
> **Q.** And you've put that extra detail in; yes?  
> **A.** Yes.  
> **Q.** Out of interest, just so I can ask you, is there any reason -- well, first of all, do you agree, the first note reads like one continuous chain of events? Do you agree?  
> **A.** Yes.  
> **Q.** It does look like it says there was a feed, then 15 minutes later an apnoeic episode and prolonged brady and desaturation; yes?  
> **A.** Yes.  
> **Q.** Now, you did that note at 8.46 that morning, so quite a few hours after this happened.  
> **A.** Yes.  
> **Q.** So why didn't you include the second event that you're telling -- sorry, the first event there?  
> **A.** Because I would have forgotten to write it. I'd written that at the end of a night shift and it was a traumatic shift so I wouldn't have remembered every single detail, so when I was next in, I added that in.  
> **Q.** And that's a couple of days later that appeared. Yes? And nothing there suggests that Lucy Letby was involved at any point in that or present, does it?  
> **A.** Not in those notes it doesn't, no.  
> **Q.** On the second incident, I'm going to suggest to you that, Miss Ellis, Lucy Letby wasn't there at the start of that incident.  
> **A.** Mm-hm. You say she was.  
> **Q.** Let me suggest to you what did happen. You can agree or disagree as you like. That second incident, I'm going to suggest that Mel Taylor was in the room, the time when there was the collapse ultimately.  
> **A.** Was this the final collapse?  
> **Q.** Yes, you described two incidents.  
> **A.** Yes.  
> **Q.** This is the second one, which leads to the collapse.  
> **MR JUSTICE GOSS:** I think you have made it clear that it's not -- your case is that Ms Letby wasn't in the (overspeaking) --  
> **MR MYERS:** Not at that start of this --  
> **MR JUSTICE GOSS:** Not in relation (overspeaking) earlier one?  
> **MR MYERS:** Not present at the first and not present at the start of the second, whatever has happened.  
> **MR JUSTICE GOSS:** That's as I understood it, anyway. Do you understand that?  
> **A.** Yes.  
> **MR MYERS:** On the second one, Mel Taylor was present; is that correct?  
> **A.** I don't know.  
> **Q.** You were there with Mel Taylor when it happened, isn't that what happened?  
> **A.** I was in the room. I don't know whether Mel Taylor was there or not.  
> **Q.** Mel Taylor went to assist [Baby C], do you remember that?  
> **A.** No.  
> **Q.** Do you remember helping Mel Taylor assisting [Baby C]?  
> **A.** No.  
> **Q.** Do you remember [Nurse B] coming in and joining you whilst that was happening?  
> **A.** I remember [Nurse B] being in there and asking me to put out a crash call.  
> **Q.** Well, you may -- I'm going to suggest to you that Lucy Letby came in some time after you and Mel were dealing with [Baby C], maybe just after [Nurse B].  
> **A.** I don't agree with that.  
> **Q.** You don't agree with that, do you? However it has come about, Miss Ellis, you have placed her there when you came to speak to the police, several years later, at a time when she wasn't there at the time?  
> **A.** I don't agree with that.  
> **Q.** You disagree. Just this after that: [Nurse B], during the resuscitation, was involved in what was taking place in [Baby C]'s care, wasn't she?  
> **A.** Yes.  
> **Q.** And she was involved in the resuscitation, wasn't she?  
> **A.** Yes.  
> **Q.** And even though she was doing that, she was able to take time to suggest to you that you leave the room; is that correct?  
> **A.** She asked me to put out the crash call, yes.  
> **Q.** She asked you to make the crash call?  
> **A.** Yes.  
> **Q.** Are you sure it wasn't Lucy Letby at any point who asked you to make the crash call?  
> **A.** I'm sure -- in my notes, in my statement it said it was [Nurse B].  
> **Q.** When you say "in my statement", you mean the statement to the police 3 years later?  
> **A.** Yes.  
> **Q.** I'm talking about the resuscitation now. During the resuscitation [Nurse B] suggested that you, is that correct, leave the room?  
> **A.** She asked me to put a crash call out and then I re-entered after I'd put it out.  
> **Q.** Yes. Did she not say that you seemed to be getting upset and you should leave the room at any point?  
> **A.** No, that wasn't [Nurse B] that said that, from memory.  
> **Q.** From memory.  
> **A.** I noticed that.

## Melanie Taylor

>Q. Thank you. Do you have a direct memory of the circumstances of [Baby C]'s collapse?
A. Yes, I do. There are obviously certain parts of it that I don't remember, but I also have a very clear memory of parts of it as well.
Q. Where were you when you first became aware that there was a significant problem with baby [Baby C]?
A. At the time of his -- when he started to deteriorate, I don't know where I was, whether I was in that nursery at the time or not.
Q. Yes.
A. But I do remember being next to the incubator and Lucy -- when I first approached the incubator, Lucy was already there. I don't know if anybody else was present at that time or not.
Q. Right. What was it that first alerted you to the fact that there was or may have been a problem with [Baby C]?
A. I don't remember at what point I realised he was starting to deteriorate. But I knew by the time I was at the incubator, next to him, we tried to do some ventilation breaths via the Neopuff and once that started, I knew that, you know, he was needing some...
Q. Thank you. And if you could, please, as best you can, picture yourself at that incubator for the first time on being alerted to a problem. Who, if anyone else, was there?
A. The only person I remember was Lucy Letby, but I think also Sophie was there as well.
Q. What leads you to think that also Sophie was or might have been there?
A. Because she was caring for her (sic) so I assume at some point, I don't know whether it was before me or after, she will have been there as well.
Q. What's the first assistance or intervention that you recall yourself or either of your colleagues performing to address the problem?
A. We tried, like I said, to give some ventilation breaths via the Neopuff. I can't remember who it was who was doing that. But I remember that. And struggling to get any chest movement while doing that.
Q. So you can recall that the Neopuff, the bag as it's sometimes referred to, was applied?
A. Yes.
Q. And you do recall that it wasn't working as expected or desired?
A. Yes.
Q. What happened next?
A. So Lucy suggested using a Guedel airway, which is a sort of plastic tube, if you are struggling with an airway, that you can pop into the mouth and into the throat. I never -- it was the first time I ever used one. I don't know whether I inserted it or Lucy, but I think it was Lucy.


>Q. Thank you. And we know, tragically, that it was futile and you would have recorded some of these events later. We'll go to your records to assist, please. If we go behind tile 189 -- well, to tile 189, forgive me. So written in retrospect at 7.20. Pausing there, we know that the initial collapse was approaching midnight and we also know that [Baby C]'s time of death was recorded at 05.58. So a couple of hours later you were writing your notes, looking backwards on the event. If we could look at Miss Taylor's notes, please. That time of 07.50 next to your MT initials is the time of the making of the note, is that right, thereabouts?  
A. Yes.  
Q. It records the following: "Call to help as baby had brady/desat." Is that literally accurate that you were called to help or don't you recall?  
A. I don't recall.  
Q. So: "When arrived [the baby] he was apnoeic, had loss of colour. Neopuff. Not able to bag." Is that what you mentioned earlier, there was no chest movement?  
A. Yes.  
Q. Hence the Guedel airway inserted?  
A. Yes.

##### Cross-exam:
>Q. This could only really properly, safely, work if she was under the supervision of someone like you, couldn't it?  
A. Yes, she [Ellis] wouldn't have been left alone to care for that baby.  
Q. And that would mean you being in the same nursery as her throughout the shift, wouldn't it?  
A. Yes.  
Q. I think when you gave your evidence, and correct me if I'm wrong, you said you weren't sure if you did have a baby in nursery 1 or not.  
A. No, I did have a baby in nursery 1.  
Q. You did, didn't you?  
A. Yes.  
Q. And part of Sophie Ellis being there and able to be there was that the two of you would be in nursery 1. That's how that was going to work, wasn't it?  
A. Yes.  
Q. And that was because, without you being there -- you being there meant there was someone else to be with her to give assistance if or when required?  
A. Yes.  
Q. It was a very busy shift, wasn't it?  
A. Yes.  
Q. I'm going to move straight to what you say about the collapse that happened. You've told us that you're not sure if you were there or not when it happened. That's what you have just said in your evidence.  
A. In the room.  
Q. In the room. You say that when you first approached the incubator, Lucy Letby was already there.  
A. Yes.  
Q. You don't remember if anyone else was present?  
A. No, I don't remember.  
Q. You said the only person you remember was Lucy?  
A. Yes.  
Q. You say you think Sophie was there too.  
A. Yes.  
Q. You're less sure about that?  
A. Yes.  
Q. In fact, you went on to say that you assumed she was there?  
A. Yes.  
Q. And you say that it was Lucy who suggested you use a Guedel airway and that she inserted it?  
A. Yes.  
Q. So it really is, from your account there, that Lucy was already there, you assist her, no one else present that you can remember, maybe Sophie?  
A. Yes.  
Q. Right. Now, I'm going to suggest this to you, Miss Taylor, and you tell us what you say about this. That you were in the nursery when this collapse happened; do you agree with that or not?  
A. I honestly can't recall whether I was or not.  
Q. That it was Sophie Ellis who called you to help her?  
A. It may have been her that called, I can't recall.  
Q. You have just said -- you have told us that the only person you remember is Lucy Letby.  
A. Yes, that is the only person, but I can't recall who called me over.  
Q. Okay. I'm going to suggest to you that after -- that Lucy Letby was not there at the start of this incident; do you agree or disagree?  
A. I disagree.  
Q. Right. I suggest the only people at the start of this were you and Sophie Ellis; do you agree or disagree?  
A. I disagree.  
Q. I suggest that when you began to attend to baby [Baby C], [Nurse B] came in; is that correct?  
A. I don't remember.  
Q. And that probably some time around about then, or just after, Lucy Letby came in at that point. You'll disagree with that?  
A. Yes.  
Q. Right. You made a statement to the police, didn't you, in these proceedings in February 2018?  
A. Yes.  
Q. And that was after the police had interviewed you; yes?  
A. Yes.  
Q. I'm going to go over with you what you said about this with the police because I'm going to suggest to you that things have changed. You've read that statement before coming into court, haven't you?  
A. Yes.  
Q. You told the police that when [Baby C] collapsed, you only mention one collapse, don't you, in that statement?  
A. Yes.  
Q. "I'm pretty sure I was in nursery 1 already." Yes? That's what you said to the police when they interviewed you, isn't it? In fact, perhaps could we put up the statements, page 962, so that Miss Taylor can see these. This is for the witness, his Lordship and the barristers, please, Mr Murphy. Again, that's not to be rude, ladies and gentlemen, but you understand. So you'll be able to see this, it's page 962. In fact, perhaps we could go to page 961 first, Mr Murphy, so we can be quite clear what's on the front of this statement. You recognise this is a copy, a typed copy, of your witness statement, Miss Taylor?  
A. Yes.  
Q. And it's got your name, your occupation. It says: "This statement, consisting of four pages each signed by me, is true to the best of my knowledge and belief, and I make it knowing that if it is tendered in evidence I will be liable to prosecution if I wilfully stated in it anything which I know to be false or do not believe to be true." I can't see it here, but this is a statement you will have read and signed and dated --  
A. Yes.  
Q. -- after the interviews with the police? Let's go to the next page, 962. We can scroll down, please, so we can see the next paragraph, so Miss Taylor can, thank you very much. The first thing it says is: "When [Baby C] collapsed I am pretty sure I was in nursery 1 already. I think I was feeding another baby." Yes?  
A. Yes.  
Q. You told the jury, and you repeated it when I asked you, that you didn't know if you were there or not.  
A. Yes, and my memory has deteriorated since this statement.  
Q. Right. So do you agree that you were in nursery 1 already when he deteriorated?  
A. I do now that I've read this again.  
Q. You read this before coming into court, didn't you?  
A. I know. I don't remember every single detail. I've only just read it again this morning.  
Q. You even give the detail in the statement you think you were feeding another baby; yes? Then you say: "I remember being called over by Sophie at about 23.30." That's what you said, isn't it?  
A. Yes.  
Q. Now, I've asked you about it and you said the only person you really remember in there was Lucy Letby.  
A. Yes, but obviously at the time I remembered that Sophie was there as well.  
Q. You don't just remember it, you remember being called over by Sophie.  
A. Yes.  
Q. You don't mention Lucy Letby anywhere in here, do you? You can read the paragraph to yourself if you like before we read on. (Pause) You don't mention her anywhere do you?  
A. No, but she was there.  
Q. You told the jury when you first approached the incubator Lucy Letby was already there. There's nothing about Lucy Letby at the incubator at all, is there?  
A. There isn't, no.  
Q. You told the jury in your evidence: "I don't remember if anyone else was present." That's what you said at first: "I don't remember if anyone else was present." What you said to the police after saying you were in the nursery was: "I remember being called over by Sophie at about 23.30."  
A. Yes. So at that time I did remember. And I have read this this morning. This is the first time I've seen it in a long time and I don't recall everything that I've written in this.  
Q. These are quite important details, aren't they?  
A. They are.  
Q. It's an incident that you will remember graphically, won't you, and what you have done in your evidence here is to say it was Lucy Letby who was there, who called you over, and what it says in the statement is that Sophie is there and that Sophie called you over?  
A. I didn't say that Lucy called me over. I remember Lucy was there. I haven't mentioned it in my witness statement, no, but also I likely wasn't asked whether Lucy was there. At the time I remembered Sophie calling me over, so I've mentioned that, but obviously now I didn't remember but now showing me that I do remember that Sophie called me over, because I've written it. But I can remember that Lucy was there.  
Q. And this morning you told the jury you didn't remember if anyone else was present apart from Lucy.  
A. No, but now reading this, I obviously (overspeaking) --  
Q. How on earth did you forget Sophie Ellis was there calling you over?  
A. In that moment, I obviously remembered this. It's years have passed since this has happened.  
Q. You went on to say to the jury: "The only person I remember was Lucy Letby."  
A. Yes.  
Q. And yet the person who you don't mention when you give this description of the collapse is Lucy Letby when you spoke to the police.  
A. True.  
Q. True. You said to the jury: "I think Sophie Ellis was there too."  
A. Yes.  
Q. But you give quite particular details in your statement to the police about what Sophie Ellis did, didn't you, like calling you over?  
A. Yes.  
Q. And you go on to say: "I attended his cot using a Neopuff device to try and assist his breathing, but got no response or improvement. I could see there was no chest movement so the air was not getting through [Baby C]'s airway. As a result, we passed a Guedel airway."  
A. (Inaudible).  
Q. The only person you mention by the time you say, "We passed a Guedel airway", is you and Sophie. That's who you're referring to when you talk to the police, isn't it?  
A. Yes.  
Q. Yet you've said to the jury -- you have given an account of how Lucy Letby is meant to have inserted the airway, haven't you?  
A. Yes, I haven't changed my mind about who was there. Obviously I've written this and Sophie -- I've said that Sophie's called me over, which she obviously did because I said that at the time. I haven't mentioned Lucy but I'm telling you now, when I approached the incubator, I approached it from -- if you're looking at the incubator the left side and she was standing on the opposite side and she was the one who suggested putting in the Guedel airway.  
Q. You told the jury -- this morning you said you think Lucy inserted it.  
A. Yes, I can't be 100% sure about that, but...  
Q. You told the police that it's you and Sophie that inserted it.  
A. Then maybe I did, I can't remember who inserted it.  
Q. You have put Lucy Letby right in the centre of this in your evidence to the jury in a way that you didn't do when you made your statement to the police, haven't you?  
A. Um... I don't really know what to say. I'm just saying what I remembered.  
Q. Is that just a mistake?  
A. What's a mistake?  
Q. That you just got confused. Is that the reason it's come about like this?  
A. No, not at all. I gave this statement a few years ago and I remember Sophie calling me over, but it's not a mistake because I remember being surprised how cool she was at the time and very calm --  
Q. I repeat to you what I put to you on behalf of Ms Letby, Miss Taylor, that it was you and Sophie Ellis who were in the nursery. You're saying at the minute that Lucy Letby was there, aren't you?  
A. Yes.  
Q. But when you spoke to the police in 2018, you told them it was you and Sophie that was there, didn't you?  
A. Yes, I haven't mentioned Lucy at all --  
Q. No.  
A. -- but it's not that -- I haven't said she was not there either. And I remember Sophie calling me over -- in my witness statement and I've put that. You know, trying to talk when you're giving your witness statement is -- it's not straightforward, it's not easy, and I said, you know, at the time what I've thought needed to be said and I said that I was called over by Sophie. You know, maybe there wasn't follow-up questions to say, "Was Lucy there?" because it's not there because I just haven't mentioned her but I can tell you that she was there.  
Q. This statement came at the end of an interview process with the police didn't it? They spoke to you?  
A. Yes.  
Q. They went away, in response to what you said in interview, and produced this statement, didn't they?  
A. Yes.  
Q. Which you then had the time you wanted to read before you signed it?  
A. Yes.  
Q. If you'd have wanted to say, "Ah, you've forgotten to put in what I want to say about Lucy Letby", you could have done, couldn't you?  
A. But I didn't think -- you know, at the time I didn't think it was necessary to put that in. I don't know what to tell you. I don't -- what I've said there is true.  
Q. This was an investigation into Lucy Letby, wasn't it?  
A. Yes.  
Q. And you were interviewed with that in mind?  
A. Yes.  
Q. So the police interview you in relation to Lucy Letby and you're telling the jury you just forgot to mention then what you said to them this morning?  
A. I can't tell you what my thought process was going through it. But I can tell you that I have told you what I know.

## Nurse B

>Q. Now let's move through the shift and let's go to the time of [Baby C]'s collapse, which is recorded on the note -- I shan't take you there -- at about 23.15 hours, so about quarter past 11 on the night of the 13th.
Where were you when you first became aware of a crisis in relation to [Baby C]?
A. I do not remember where I was, but I was not in nursery 1.
Q. Do you recall what alerted you to the crisis?
A. A shout for help.
Q. Do you recall who shouted?
A. No.
Q. Do you recall what was shouted?
A. I think "help".
Q. Thank you.
A. I immediately went in.
Q. On entering nursery 1, what did you see? I don't remember. How did you respond?
A. From memory and reading my statement this morning, I saw Mel and Sophie with [Baby C].
Q. Mel Taylor, Sophie Ellis?
A. Yes.
Q. Where were they?
A. They were beside his incubator.
Q. And what were they doing?
A. They were -- they had a Neopuff device. They were trying to ventilate him because he wasn't breathing.


>Q. Doing the best you could at the time you spoke to the police in 2018, was it your recollection that you were dealing with Jacob and Lucy when, some time between 10 and 11, you were called to assist with [Baby C]?  
A. So I don't mean directly with them, I wasn't beside them, but my time was consumed by that fact, yes.  
Q. Just so there's no mystery, what you'd said was: "I was dealing with Jacob and Lucy when, sometime between 10 and 11, I was called to assist with [Baby C]."  
A. Yes.  
Q. So you're saying you can't say precisely where you were or what you were doing, but that was the sort of thing you'd been doing?  
A. Yes.  
Q. All right. You certainly weren't in nursery 1 at that point when you were called to assist, were you?  
A. No.  
Q. But as you've told us this morning, when you entered nursery 1, you saw Sophie and Melanie Neopuffing [Baby C]?  
A. That's my memory.  
Q. And that's what you told the police in 2018?  
A. It is.  
Q. Yes. You went on -- I don't want you to be at any disadvantage. Could we let Ms [Nurse B] see page 971 of the statement, please? Again, this is for Mrs [Nurse B]'s benefit, his Lordship and the lawyers. Ladies and gentlemen, it's not being rude, it's just to assist with recollection. Perhaps it's less of a mystery if you have the statement in front of you that you made and signed in 2018, Mrs [Nurse B]. So what you told the police was you remember that you had seen [Baby C] early in the shift and confirmed that Sophie and Melanie were okay. And as I was asking: "[You were] dealing with Jacob and Lucy when, some time between 10 and 11, [you were] called to assist with [Baby C]." That's to the best of your recollection?  
A. Yes.  
Q. What you told the police was: "When [you] entered nursery 1, Sophie and Melanie were Neopuffing [Baby C] in an attempt to assist his breathing."  
A. Yes.  
Q. If we just look on, I'm summarising, you describe the situation with the bradycardia and the low oxygen levels and what was happening with the Neopuff. And, as you told us, you couldn't recall who had made a crash call, but a crash call was put out.  
A. Yes.  
Q. You said: "Sometimes premature babies do forget to breathe for themselves and a brief spell of Neopuff is enough to wake them up. It can also be a sign of infection or a bleed on the brain, but normally they respond." Is that correct?  
A. In general, yes.  
Q. In general. I just want to read on to see where it is that you mention Lucy for the first time: "I remember the doctor intubating [Baby C] at some point and when it became clear that [Baby C] was not responding, we put out the crash call for the consultant, Dr Gibbs. As always he arrived very quickly." That was your recollection; yes?  
A. The initial crash call, because it was the night shift, remember, so the initial crash call brings you the SHO and the registrar. So they will arrive within a few minutes because they're on site. They weren't on the neonatal unit, as I said earlier. Then an additional crash call is put out for the consultant, who is potentially off site because it's a night shift.  
Q. That's right. And that was Dr Gibbs on this occasion?  
A. Yes.  
Q. And he came later, didn't he, a little later?  
A. Yes.  
Q. [Baby C]'s mother was upstairs on the post-natal ward and she was called down around the same time?  
A. Yes.  
Q. You say: "I also think Lucy was in the room by now as well." Meaning there were four nurses present?  
A. Yes.  
Q. So it seems at some point after you got there, you had been joined by Lucy?  
A. Obviously, I did this 3 years after the incident.  
Q. All right.  
A. That's what I've written in my statement.  
Q. "I also think Lucy was in the room by now."  
A. Mm-hm.  
#### Re-exam:
>Q. How sure are you as to who was in the room when you first entered to respond to the crisis?
A. As I said, it was 3 years after the event, so from my memory at that point in time Sophie and Mel were there.
Q. Yes. How sure are you?
A. Well, I've written there "not 100%" -- well, I haven't written that, that's not in my statement, that's during my interview.
Q. Thank you. I'm grateful to Mr Johnson. That is our page reference K2703, my Lord.
MR JUSTICE GOSS: Well, I think for the sake of completeness we could...
*"Question: Just to confirm, who exactly was in the room when you went in to answer the crash?*
*Answer: I believe it was Sophie and Mel.*
*Question: Okay. But I 100% couldn't tell you."*
So those are her exact words.

## Lucy Letby

#### First police interview (4 July 2018)
>Q. So when did you first become aware of this requirement to resuscitate [Baby C]?  
A. I don't remember.  
Q. Was it something that you discovered, for example, or was it something you were alerted to and you reacted to?  
A. I don't think I discovered it. I think I'd been asked to help. I think I became a part of it afterwards.  
Q. Okay.  
A. I think I'd been asked to help.  
Q. You say you don't think, is that because you don't remember?  
A. I don't remember.


>Q. Right, okay. So you think or you know that he dropped his respiratory --  
A. I think.  
Q. Is that from memory?  
A. Yes.  
Q. How would you become aware of that then, Lucy?  
A. Either somebody alerted me or his monitor would alarm.  
Q. Right. Do you remember somebody alerting you about that?  
A. I don't remember.


>Q. Do you know if you were asked to look after any baby whilst a nurse was on her break at all, in particular [Baby C]?  
A. Not that I recall.

#### Second police interview (11 July 2019) 
>Q. She goes on to say that when she went into nursery 1 in response to the alarms, she says that you were standing next to [Baby C]'s cot as she entered. Do you agree with that?
A. I don't remember specifically when I entered the room or why I entered the room.  
Q. Nurse Sophie Ellis says that you said, "He's just dropped his HR in saturations", or something similar. Do you recall saying that to Sophie Ellis?  
A. No.  
Q. You were placed into nursery 3 during this shift and had your own designated baby to look after; do you agree with this?  
A. Not from memory. I'd have to check. If that's documented as being right then yes, it would of. I don't remember.  
Q. Okay, Lucy, have you got any explanation as to why you were already in nursery 1 when [Baby C]'s alarms were sounding?  
A. I don't recall from memory. I may have been in there doing the checks that we do in the ITU room, I may have been getting a drug out of the cupboard, might have been using the computer. I might have heard his alarms.  
Q. Okay. What checks are they, Lucy?  
A. There's the resus trolley that's in the room and the ITU spaces were all checked each evening.  
Q. Would you do all that whilst caring for other babies then?  
A. Yes.  
Q. Had you been treating [Baby C] at this time, Lucy?  
A. Not that I remember.  
Q. Have you got any explanation as to why you were stood at [Baby C]'s cot side as Sophie Ellis has told us?  
A. No. As I say, not from memory. I don't recall why specifically I was there.  
Q. The comments that you've made to her, "He's just dropped his HR and saturations", or something similar to that. Have you got any explanation as to why you made that comment to Sophie?  
A. That's what I must have witnessed alarming on the alarm and that's when she come in -- sorry, that's when she's come.  
Q. You have got no explanation as to why you're in nursery 1?  
A. No. As I said, I don't recall.

>Q. Okay. I'll just tell you something, Lucy, that might help you. So you sent that final text to Jen at 23.09 and [Baby C] collapsed at 23.15.  
A. Right.  
Q. So 6 minutes after you sent that message, [Baby C] has collapsed.  
A. Right.  
Q. What are your thoughts on that?  
A. I don't have any thoughts on that.  
Q. So you sent a text to Jen at 23.09, [Baby C]'s alarm has then sounded, Sophie Ellis has seen you at his cot side, and he collapsed at 23.15 hours.  
A. Right.  
Q. What are your thoughts on that?  
A. I don't recall where I was at that time that I sent that text. I might have been at the nurses' station and then I've gone into nursery 1 to do something else.  
Q. Mm-hm. The text messages suggest that you were frustrated, Lucy, that you weren't working in nursery 1. Do you agree? I'll just remind you what you said there --  
A. Yes. I think I felt that it would help if I could have been in nursery 1.  
Q. "I just feel I need to be in 1 to get the image out of my head. Being in 3 is eating me up. All I can see is him in 1." Yeah?  
A. Yes.  
Q. And within 6 minutes, as my colleague said, you were in nursery 1?  
A. Yeah.  
Q. Do you agree with that, Lucy?  
A. Yes.  
Q. And within them 6 minutes, [Baby C]'s collapsed?  
A. Yes.  
Q. Did you cause [Baby C] to collapse, Lucy, when you went into him 6 minutes after that conversation?  
A. No.  
Q. You were the only staff member in the nursery at the time [Baby C] collapsed as well, weren't you?  
A. Yes.  
Q. Yeah. And you were seen at his cot side when his alarm sounded, weren't you?  
A. Yeah.

#### Exam in chief:

>Q. Do you recall which nursery you were in or nurseries?  
A. Nursery 3.  
Q. And do you recall which nursery [Baby C] was in?  
A. Nursery 1.  
Q. When it comes to recalling what took place that night, how much are you able to recall on your own recollections and how much on other matters given to you to assist with recollections?  
A. I have very little independent memory.  
Q. Right. Little independent memory?  
A. Yes.

>Q. What was the first you were aware of, of any event concerning [Baby C]?  
A. At the time of his collapse.  
Q. At the time of. Can you give us a bit more detail than that? When your recollection kicks in with detail, what is it?  
A. So he was receiving support at that time and I was called to help.  
Q. Right. Before you were called to help, were you aware of anything taking place with [Baby C]?  
A. No.  
Q. Doing the best you can to recall this, where were you before you were called to help?  
A. I wasn't in nursery 1.  
Q. Right. Do you recall who called you to help?  
A. I believe it was Sophie Ellis.  
Q. Once you'd been called to help, what happened next?  
A. I don't have a lot of independent memory, but I believe I asked Sophie to go and put out a crash call and Melanie Taylor was with [Baby C].  
Q. Let's just pause a moment, you've talked about Melanie Taylor now. When were you first aware of Melanie Taylor?  
A. Melanie Taylor was in the nursery when I arrived.  
Q. Right. When you arrived?  
A. Yes.  
Q. So you had been called to help?  
A. Yes.  
Q. Where did you go after you were called to help?  
A. Into nursery 1, to [Baby C].  
Q. Once you went there, do you recall what you could see?  
A. Mel was with [Baby C]. I just remember that he was apnoeic and needed respiratory support, so I asked Sophie to put out a crash call.  
Q. Right. Do you recall anybody else being present at that point?  
A. I believe [Nurse B] was there as well.  
Q. Do you believe that from your own recollection or do you believe that from things you've heard since then?  
A. Um, no, I do have some recollection of that.  
Q. That she was there?  
A. Yes.

>Q. And the officer is talking about Nurse Sophie Ellis, who's been spoken to. This is the officer reporting this:  
"Question: She was out of the room at the nurses’ station when [Baby C]'s alarm sounded. She says that you had your own designated baby who was in nursery 3. Do you agree with that?"  
"Answer: No, as I've said before I don't remember who I was looking after on that shift, I would have to look and check."  
Just pausing there, why do you know it was nursery 3 now?  
A. Because when I was informed of the babies' initials of that evening shift, I could recall that baby.  
Q. You are asked:  
"Question: She goes on to say that when she went into nursery 1 in response to alarms she says that you were standing next to [Baby C]'s cot as you entered. Do you agree with that?"  
"Answer: I don't specifically remember when I entered the room or why I entered the room."  
So as matters stood do you agree that you were standing next to the cot?  
A. No.  
Q. Do you have any recollection that you were standing next to the cot?  
A. No.  
Q. Do you recall alarms going off in particular?  
A. I recall alarms going, yes.  
Q. You do recall alarms?  
A. Yes.  
Q. You told the police:  
"Answer: I don't specifically remember when I entered the room and why."  
"Question: Nurse Sophie Ellis says that you said, 'He's just dropped his HR and sats', or something similar. Do you recall saying that to Sophie Ellis?"  
And you said no. Now looking back at this, do you recall saying anything like that to Sophie Ellis?  
A. No.  
Q. Over the page. Just this page that I want to deal with, page 112:  
"Question: You were placed into nursery 3 during this shift and had your own designated baby to look after. Do you agree with this?"  
"Answer: Not from memory, I'd have to check. If that's documented as being right then yes, it would have. I don't remember."  
"Question: Okay, Lucy, have you got any explanation as to why you were already in nursery 1 when [Baby C]'s alarms were sounding?"  
Pausing there, did you have any recollection of being in nursery 1 prior to the alarms sounding?  
A. No.  
Q. Or of what Sophie Ellis had said to the police?  
A. No.  
Q. You say:  
"Answer: I don't recall from memory. I may have been in there doing the checks that we do in the ITU room, I may have been getting a drug out of the cupboard, I might have been using the computer, I might have heard his alarms, I don't recall."  
Why were you suggesting all those things if you didn't recall where you were?  
A. Because based on the interview of Sophie Ellis, she had placed me in the nursery.  
Q. Do you mean based on the statement of Sophie Ellis?  
A. Yes, sorry, yes.  
Q. What the police were saying to you?  
A. Yes.  
Q. The police say:  
"Question: What checks are they, Lucy?"  
"Answer: There's the resus trolley that's in the room and the ITU spaces are all checked each evening."  
"Question: Would you do all that whilst caring for other babies then?"  
"Answer: Yes."  
As it happens, are those checks a nurse might do whilst caring for other babies?  
A. Yes, they are, yes.  
Q. But had you actually been in there, in that room, when [Baby C] desaturated?  
A. No.  
Q. Question:  
"Had you been treating [Baby C] at this time, Lucy?"  
You said:  
"Answer: Not that I remember."  
Pausing there, did you have anything like the neonatal review that we have now to refer back to when you were being interviewed?  
A. No.  
Q. Question:  
"Have you got any explanation as to why you were stood at [Baby C]'s cot side as Sophie Ellis has told us?"  
"Answer: Not as I -- no. As I say, not from memory. I don't recall why specifically I was there."  
Pausing there, had you actually remembered that you were there?  
A. No.  
Q. Why were you talking or beginning to talk about being there then?  
A. Because from the statement of Sophie Ellis, that's what had been put to me, that I was there.  
Q. Right. We know that -- if we actually read just to the end of this section. The comments -- she talks about the comments that Sophie Ellis said you'd made:  
"Question: Got any explanation as to why you made that comment to Sophie?"  
"Answer: That's what I must have witnessed, alarming, on the alarm, and that's when she's come."  
Did you actually have any recollection of being there with the alarm sounding and saying anything to Sophie?  
A. No.  
Q. So why were you talking about saying things to Sophie?  
A. Because that was the suggestion, that Sophie had said I was there and I was thinking of reasons, if that was correct, why I would have been there.  
Q. And the officer says:  
"Question: Okay, you've got no explanation as to why you're in nursery 1?"  
"Answer: No. As I said I don't recall."  
A. Mm.  
Q. We know that also in 2018, [Nurse B] had made a statement to the police. That's in evidence, we've heard that. She was asked about that when she gave evidence. Did the police at any point, when faced with you saying you didn't recall things, tell you about what [Nurse B] had said in her statement?  
A. No.  
Q. Was there any reference to what she'd said, that she'd been dealing with [redacted] and Lucy when some time between 10 and 11, [Nurse B] was called to assist with [Baby C]?  
A. No.  
Q. Any reference to that to assist with your memory?  
A. At the police interview?  
Q. Yes.  
A. No.  
Q. And again with regard to the statement from [Nurse B] dated 2018, was there any reference to you to assist with memory that she had said that when she entered nursery 1: "Sophie and Melanie were Neopuffing [Baby C] in an attempt to assist with breathing"?  
A. No.  
Q. Did they assist you with that?  
A. No.  
Q. And also from that same statement, raised with her in evidence in this trial, when describing the attendance of the doctors to intubate [Baby C], she said: "I also think Lucy was in the room by now as well." Was your memory assisted with that?  
A. No.  
Q. Whatever you said in response to what was identified from Sophie Ellis, did you have an independent recollection of what took place that night?  
A. I had some recollection.  
Q. Starting from where?  
A. So I believed that I had been called to help.  
Q. Right. Had you had any involvement with [Baby C] before that?  
A. No.  
Q. Or any recollection of involvement before that?  
A. No.  
Q. Did you accept as accurate what the police were telling you with regard to Sophie Ellis?  
A. Yes.  
Q. And by that I mean what she'd said in her statement, you accepted that from the police?  
A. Yes, so from what they told me, I assumed that to be true.

#### Cross-exam

>Q. Paragraph 53:  
"I think I heard the alarms going off but I didn't go straight to [Baby C]. I don't know whether I was walking past the nursery or how I came to go in there. It may have been I was called in because of the collapse, but at night-time sometimes we have to go into nursery 1 even if we're working in nursery 3, for example, to check equipment for the ITU spaces, but I don't recall being in there when [Baby C] collapsed."  
Paragraph 56:  
"I did have some contact with [Baby C]'s family, but not to the extent described by his mother."  
As a matter of fact, just on that point, [Mother of Baby C]'s evidence was agreed, wasn't it? Do you remember it was read to the jury?  
A. Yes.

>Q. Yes, you say: "I don't recall where I was at the time that I sent that text."  
A. Yes.  
Q. "I might have been at the nurses' station and then I've gone into nursery 1 to do something else."  
A. Yes, because just previous to that it was stated to me that Sophie Ellis had seen me at the cot side and I took that to be accurate.  
Q. It is accurate, isn't it?  
A. It was on her word at that time.  
Q. You were quite happy to accept it, were you?  
A. I haven't accepted it, I've said I don't recall.


> Q. And do you accept that you were in nursery 1 at the time [Baby C] collapsed?  
A. No.  
Q. Why did you tell the police that you did accept it?  
A. Based on what Sophie Ellis saw and what was told to me, I took that to be accurate. I have no memory of being in the room.  
Q. If you have no memory, how can you dispute?  
A. I dispute the fact that I have not agreed that I was definitely in the nursery.  
Q. I'll put the question a different way then. Are you disputing that you were in the room at the time [Baby C] collapsed?  
A. Yes, I have no recollection of that.  
Q. Well, I'm going to suggest to you -- I'm not going to do this every time because otherwise we'll be here a long time, but I'm going to suggest to you that you're ignoring the question and in due course I may suggest to the jury that the reason you're ignoring the question is because you can't answer the question. All right? So I'll give you one more opportunity to answer it. Do you dispute that you were in the room at the time [Baby C] collapsed?  
A. Yes.  
Q. Why?  
A. Because I have no memory of that.  
Q. Do you remember being born?  
A. No.  
Q. Do you dispute that you were born?  
A. No.
