**Melanie Taylor:**
> Q.   So going to Monday, 8 June 2015, is it right that  you were allocated as designated nurse for both [Baby A]  and [Baby B]? 
A.   Yes. 
Q.   Both the twins were in nursery room 1 -- 
A.   Yes. 
Q.   -- is that right, the ICU room?     And I'm going to ask  Mr Murphy if he could play the video recording that we  watched just before lunchtime.    It's a recording within  nursery 1 at a time when all the machinery and the like  was in there but, of course, taken well after the events  that we're -- just so you can assist us as to your  recollection as to who was where if you're able to. 
A.   Yes.  
(Video played to the court) 
Q.   Do you recognise that as nursery 1 or the ICU -- 
A.   Yes. 
Q.   -- at the Countess of Chester Hospital? 
A.   Yes. 
Q.   A room you're well familiar with? 
A.   Yes. 
Q.   When did you begin work at the Countess of Chester  Hospital? 
A.   2010.  
Q.   Thank you.   Did you begin as a band 5 nurse? 
A.   Yes. 
Q.   Am I right that at the time that we are considering,  you'd become a band 6 nurse? 
A.   Yes. 
Q.   But relatively recently? 
A.   Yes. 
Q.   Do you actually remember where [Babies A & B]  were within that nursery on the morning? 
A.   Yes, this is also looking back at my notes, my statement  that I've given, because obviously that was a couple of  years ago.   So my memory was clearer then than it is  now. 
Q.   Yes. 
A.   So as the video, you were going in, the first on the  right-hand side door, the first door, [Baby B] was on the  far right side. 
Q.   Would it help if we played the video again and -- 
MR JUSTICE GOSS:    I think, so we can just lay out the  geography so that we've all seen -- because you know it,  we are only seeing it from here.   There are clearly two  doors from the corridor into it. 
A.   Yes. 
MR JUSTICE GOSS:    The camera goes in first through the door  on the right and pans around and we can see on the right   there is one behaviour, then there are two more in  front. 
A.   Yes. 
MR JUSTICE GOSS:    And where there's a partial separation  into the next door room, so it comes out of that door,  you can obviously go through it, go through one part of  the big room to the other, but if you go in the other  door then there are more incubators there, a total of  four. 
A.   Yes. 
MR JUSTICE GOSS:    So would it be helpful if we numbered  them?    Did they have numbers? 
A.   If they did we didn't tend to refer to them. 
MR JUSTICE GOSS:    All right.   I think what you've described,  tell me obviously if I'm wrong, is it was in the  right-hand one as you go in that first door. 
A.   Yes. 
MR JUSTICE GOSS:    Right.   So we can look at that one. 
A.   Yes, if it was right-hand incubator, incubator 1. 
MR JUSTICE GOSS:    Yes. 
A.   Next one along, 2, 3, and then the left-hand side, 4.  [Baby B], I think, was in incubator 1.   [Baby A] was in  incubator 2. 
MR JUSTICE GOSS:    So you recall them being next door to each  other?  
A.   Yes.   [Baby B] -- I'm like 95%, about [Baby B] being in  incubator 1, but [Baby A] was in incubator 2. 
MR DRIVER:    Thank you.   We can play it again. 
(Video played to the court) 
MR DRIVER:    There's a breakdown in the link to the satellite  court. 
MR JUSTICE GOSS:    I thought it had been deliberately paused  at that point. 
MR DRIVER:    It has, both!  Thank you.   Pause there.   Of the incubators on the  screen now you tried to help us by numbering them.       Are  they the incubators you were numbering? 
A.   Yes. 
Q.   And the one to the right of our screen as we look at it,  what number do you give that? 
A.   Number 1, where I'm pretty sure [Baby B] was.    Number 2  where [Baby A] was. 
Q.   Right.   Thank you.   Can you remember whether or not the  other incubators were occupied during this shift or  can't you remember? 
A.   I can't remember.     I know we were very busy and the  likelihood is they were, but I couldn't say for certain. 


Next bit:

>Q.   And on this occasion, the end of your shift on 8 June,  can you recall who it was that you were handing over the  care of [Babies A & B] to?  
A.   I don't remember physically handing over to a person,  but I know, looking back at my notes, it will have been  Lucy Letby. 
Q.   All right.    You have no recollection, direct  recollection, of that handover; is that what you're  saying? 
A.   Yes, that's what I'm saying. 
Q.   Do you recall making up these notes? 
A.   Actually writing the notes? 
Q.   Yes. 
A.   I don't -- I remember sitting at the computer to write  some notes, so the computer that you saw in the video.  I remember sitting there when [Baby A] started to  deteriorate and I will have just left those notes  (inaudible) -- I wouldn't have finished them.    So I  would have started to write some -- they are the ones  that I remember writing but they will not have been  saved because that's when he started to deteriorate and  I offered to help. 
Q.   Let's take this in stages.    I wonder whether we could go  back to the video so you can inform the jury as to which  computer you would have been using and we can all  familiarise ourselves with its location.  (Video played to the court)  Could you pause it there, please?   We can see two   screens there.    Are either of those the computer you're  referring to? 
A.   Yes. 
Q.   Mr Murphy, could you put the cursor on one.  Is it that screen or the other? 
A.   That one, yes. 
Q.   We can see that is up against a wall.     You indicated  earlier -- could you confirm that the incubator  immediately to the left of a person who would be sitting  at that computer is the one that you are sure  [Baby A] was in or not? 
A.   The one behind that.   You can't quite see it from this  angle. 
MR JUSTICE GOSS:     I think let the recording continue. 
MR DRIVER:    Thank you.  If we go back a minute or so.  (Video playing continued)  Pausing there, go back a few seconds, please,  Mr Murphy.  Are they the incubators that you referred us to  earlier where [Babies A & B] -- 
A.   Yes. 
Q.   -- were being cared for?   The one to our right you're  95% sure that was [Baby B]'s incubator.    The one to the  left of centre of the screen you're sure was   [Baby A]'s.  So then we continue, please, to take us to the  computer in question.  (Video playing continued)  Pause there.   So the terminal there in the bottom  right corner of the screen.  Going back to 8 June, you've no recollection of the  interaction with Lucy Letby, the exchange of information  from you to her about [Baby A]? 
A.   No. 
Q.   But do you recall the nature of the report that you  would have made at this point in time? 
A.   I mean, I don't remember what I handed over because  I don't remember the handover.     But from reading my  notes, I will have handed over all the different areas,  respiratory, fluids, what had happened throughout the  shift, but that he had been stable respiratory-wise and  that there were no concerns.     It was the fluids that was  the main concern, just getting some fluids connected. 
Q.   Are you able to say whether he was put on fluids before  or after your shift, your responsibility for his care  ended? 
A.   I can't remember.     It may be that I've -- I'm not sure  whether I've referred to that in my notes or in my  statement.    I can't remember at the moment.  
Q.   Let's, please, go to -- we'll come back to this in  a moment.    Go to slide 174, please.   Click on there,  please.    And the original document, please.  Are you familiar with this sort of document? 
A.   Yes. 


Next:

> Q.   Is that the note that you had a recollection -- 
A.   Yes. 
Q.   -- that you may after all have recorded that event?   So we know from the dextrose chart that we looked at  a few minutes ago that you've signed to the effect that  the flow of the fluids began at 20.05. 
A.   Yes. 
Q.   The time of the handover, are you able to assist us with  regards to that? 
A.   So it will have been -- the verbal handover will have  been between 7.30 and 8. 
Q.   Yes. 
A.   We officially finish at 8, so that's generally when the  next nurse will take over and that's what I've written  in my notes, that she took over the care after my verbal  handover at 8. 
Q.   Yes.   At which you told us you sat at the computer  within room 1 -- 
A.   Yes. 
Q.   -- that you've identified? 
A.   Yes. 
Q.   You began the process of making notes? 
A.   Yes. 
Q.   You didn't complete that process.   Did you tell the  jury, therefore, the note itself would not have been  retained, would not have been kept? 
A.   Yes.   I mean, I can't remember what I wrote in it, but  I remember sitting at that computer to write notes.   I don't know how far I'd got, whether I had started or  was mid-note, but that was the point when [Baby A] started  to deteriorate and I got up. 
Q.   Are you therefore able to assist as to how long you'd  been at that computer station for? 
A.   I don't know, sorry. 
Q.   How did you know that there was a problem with [Baby A]?  What alerted you to it? 
A.   So that computer that I was sat at, was sitting at,  there is -- so it's a bit difficult to visualise it from  the video. 
Q.   Yes. 
A.   When you're sitting in front of that computer, you can  see the incubator that [Baby A] was in.   So I -- I have  a sort of a direct line, visual line, although he's not  right next to me I could see that he started to  deteriorate.   So his heart rate dropped and his  saturations dropped and Lucy Letby was standing by the  incubator.  Initially I stayed because there he was fairly  stable and Lucy was there, so I sat there and then when  I realised actually he wasn't recovering from the  deterioration, I then got up to help Lucy. 
Q.   What informed you of the deterioration?   Was it the  sound of an alarm, was it the content of the screen of   the monitors or both or what? 
A.   It probably will have been both.   So there is a monitor  above the incubator, which has the heart rate,  saturation levels and respiratory rate.     When they fall  out of a normal range, the monitor will alarm. 
Q.   Thank you.   To go back, the handover would have taken  place at the cot side? 
A.   Yes. 
Q.   At the incubator side, more accurately.     Thereafter,  would you have left the nursery or gone straight to the  computer that you've shown us?   What happened, can you  remember? 
A.   I can't remember. 
Q.   You can't remember.    At the time you were at the  computer and you became aware of a problem coming from  [Baby A]'s incubator, where was Lucy Letby? 
A.   She was standing next to the incubator. 
Q.   Are you able to say how long you'd been away from the  incubator for? 
A.   I don't know, sorry. 
Q.   Are you able to say a point in time when you sat down  at the computer?    Was that before or after the dextrose  infusion had begun down the long line? 
A.   I can't say for certain, but I think it was after. 
Q.   And how did you react?   What did you do?  


Next:
> Q.   Thank you.   We can take that down, please, Mr Murphy.  I'm going to ask if we can just have a look at a map  that we've been given of nursery 1.   You might have it  there, Miss Taylor.   Ladies and gentlemen, you have it  and your Lordship does.   It should be behind divider 4  in that bundle in front of you.  We can see nursery 1 marked in the centre; is that  correct? 
A.   Yes. 
Q.   Can you see the one on the green plan? 
A.   Yes. 
Q.   There we are, thank you, Mr Murphy.  Perhaps, just to help, so we can refer to this, when  we look in there it's got four incubators marked, hasn't  it? 
A.   Yes.  
Q.   And you referred to them as incubators 1, 2, 3 and 4? 
A.   Yes. 
Q.   Are those actually set numbers for those incubators, if  you see what I mean?   Or is that just how you call them? 
A.   No, that's just how I was -- yes. 
Q.   Was there any way of referring to which incubator was  which so a nurse would know who they were talking about? 
A.   Um...    Not that I can remember. 
Q.   Right.   In any event, when you described the position  that you were in and the computer and looking across,  the incubator [Baby A] was in is the one we can see on the  right-hand side on its own, below 5.5 metres?   Is that  correct? 
A.   No, that was, I think, [Baby B]. 
Q.   That's [Baby B].   And [Baby A] is, sorry, to the right of  where it says 8.6 metres? 
A.   Yes. 
Q.   Thank you.   Can you see actually, if you stay there for  a moment, above the top wall of the nursery, can you see  it says "window blocked by film"? 
A.   Yes. 
Q.   We saw this on the video.   I just wonder whether we  could just put up -- we call it D1, which is some  photographs that come from exhibits.   I'm going to ask  you about that.   Pausing there.   We've got the map in front of us.  We've got the photograph.   Is that the view?   If we look  at the map, the plan, above where it says "neonatal  unit" there's a door.   At the N of neonatal, can you see  the door? 
A.   Yes. 
Q.   Can everybody see that, ladies and gentlemen, in front  of you on the plans?  (Pause)  That's the view standing at the door of the N of  neonatal looking straight into that room, isn't it? 
A.   Yes. 
Q.   So in fact opposite there, although it says "windows  blocked by film", there was a kind of cartoon picture  that went halfway up the window with those figures on  it; is that correct? 
A.   Yes. 
Q.   On the other side of that window we can see from the  plan there's a corridor that runs behind it? 
A.   Yes. 
Q.   Can we just look at the next photograph, please, so  we can see just how far along that goes.   There we are.  Just to help with that.  The computer that you were telling us about is just  to the right of where we've got the numbers J133, isn't   it? 
A.   Yes. 
Q.   When you were working at that computer filling in notes  would you be standing or sitting? 
A.   Sitting. 
Q.   Sitting.  We can take that down, thank you, Mr Murphy.  In fact, since the time of these photographs, the  Countess of Chester neonatal unit has relocated to  a different part of the hospital, hasn't it? 
A.   Yes. 
Q.   It's a much bigger unit now, isn't it? 
A.   Yes. 
Q.   Much larger rooms and more modern equipment. 
A.   Um...   Some of the equipment is more modern, some of  it is the same. 
MR MYERS:    Thank you.  My Lord, I'm going to turn to the shift and details  relating to that.    I wonder whether this might be  a suitable point to stop. 
MR JUSTICE GOSS:    Yes, certainly. 
MR MYERS:    Thank you, Miss Taylor. 
MR JUSTICE GOSS:    10.30 tomorrow then, please, ladies and  gentlemen.   Remember your obligations: no communication  with anyone other than a fellow juror when you're all   together and no research about anyone or anything to do  with this case.     Thank you very much.  (In the absence of the jury)  I'm going to say this in the presence of the  defendant and the witness because it's just something  that I wanted to clear up.  We've seen the walk-through, we haven't actually got  an identified date for when that walk through took  place, but it's been shown to the witness and the jury  and now we've seen some still photographs.      They aren't  exactly the same, I don't think.      Were the stills taken  from the video? 
MR MYERS:   Maybe not from the one we've just seen, but, as  I understand it, they're contemporaneous with the  earlier material we've seen.      They come from the  exhibits.   We can confirm the date, but they're provided  by the prosecution. 
MR JUSTICE GOSS:     I know.   Unless it's me getting things  wrong, there are just slightly small differences. 
MR MYERS:   Right. 
MR JUSTICE GOSS:     And the plan itself is not a wholly  accurate plan in relation to the depiction of where the  incubators were in relation to the wall.       These are all  very small points. 
MR MYERS:   Yes.  
MR JUSTICE GOSS:    But it's just a bit difficult when we're  dealing with events that we know took place a long time  ago and things will have changed round.      Witnesses will  all have the difficulty of remembering exactly how it  was at the particular time.      I just don't want anyone to  be misled.      It's just that if the jury see something and  they pick these things up, they may raise them.     So if  we could just have a little more clarity, if possible,  as to when these items that we've seen were actually  taken, it would help everyone. 


Next:

>MR MYERS:
In fact, they're not all taken on the sameoccasion, so we shall establish the dates.
But that's
when those ones were taken.
In fact, just dealing with that, the incubators or
cots that we saw in nursery 1, they're not fixed in the
positions that they're drawn on the plan, are they?
A.The incubators are movable, yes, on wheels.
Q.So they can be moved around sometimes, from time to
time, for whatever reason?
A.
Yes, they tend to be -- there are designated spaces but
they can move, yes.

Next:
> Q.Let's have a look.
(Pause)
Enlarge that, please.
I'm looking for an entry at
20.14 or thereabouts.
If we just look at the bottom entry there, please,
Miss Taylor.
"20.18.
Can you see, it says:
08/06."
This is on [Baby B]'s notes.
So this would be typed
up sitting at the computer that you've already
identified on the photographs, wouldn't it?
A.
That's -- well, yes, I don't know if that was the notes
that I was writing at the time of his deterioration, but
I was -- I assume that I was at that computer because
I remember sitting at that computer.
Q.
What we can see is you were at that computer certainly
at 20.18?
A.Yes.
Q.So we know that's where you were at that time.
CanI check, do you recall whether at this point Dr Harkness
was also in that room?
A.I don't remember.
Q.In any event, whilst you were there, you've described to
us you could see over to where [Baby A]'s incubator was.
A.Yes.
Q.And the alarm sounded; is that correct?
A.Yes.
Q.Ms Letby was over there?
A.Yes.
Q.But she was [Baby A]'s designated nurse --
A.Yes.
Q.-- that's correct, isn't it?
And you'd expect
a designated nurse coming on to be taking checks and
observations and making sure the baby they're looking
after is comfortable and in a good condition?
A.Yes.
Q.When you went over to [Baby A], do you recall whether
he was breathing at that point or not?
A.I don't recall.


**DR Harkness**

> Q.Do you have any recollection as to where in the nursery
[Baby A] was placed, in which incubator, where that
incubator was?
A.
Yes.
With it being quite a traumatic experience, my
memory was actually quite fresh.
Coming into the
nursery -- I've got a map here, the maps -- essentially,
you come into the nursery.
On my right-hand side was
[Baby A]'s sister in an incubator.
And then at 90 degrees
to her, straight ahead of me through the door, was
[Baby A].
Then 90 degrees to him was another baby who
I can't remember the name of, but there were three
babies in that room (inaudible) spread out throughout
the room.
Q.
What we'll do now, Dr Harkness, for our benefit as for
yours, we'll replay a short video recording taken afterthe events, obviously while incubators were in situ
within that nursery (overspeaking) and you can help as
to your recollection as to (overspeaking).
(Video played to the court)
If Mr Murphy could play that again and while it's
playing if you could identify for our benefit, to your
recollection, where the babies were.
A.
So looking through this door here, straight ahead from
the two cubicles, the one that's to the right-hand side
there, the one that you can just see to the right, would
be where [Baby A] was.
Q.The one nearest the camera now?
A.No, the one on the right-hand side now.
(indicating).
This one there
So he would have been there (indicating),
slightly positioned over, I think, from my recollection.
His sister was then 90 degrees into this incubator here.
So they were both on that side.
And then the third baby
was back on the other side of the room, heading this way
now, so where that incubator (indicating) is now.
Q.
Thank you.
MR JUSTICE GOSS:
There were just the three incubators in
the room or were the there four where they are now, but
the one in between [Baby A] and the other baby was not
occupied?
A.
I can't remember, your Honour.
What tended to happen is
you would only keep the incubators with the babies in itand the others would be kept outside the room.
So from
what I remember there was just the three there, but
I can't be 100% sure.
MR JUSTICE GOSS:
Anyway, you know where [Baby A] was and you
know where [Baby B] was?
MR DRIVER:
To complete this, Dr Harkness, I think at an
earlier stage you made a sketch to assist and inform the
police as to your recollection.
up.
If we could get that
It is the exhibit at J888, please.

Next:
>Q.If we could go to slide, first, 185, please.
So
slide 185, written after the event, intended to record
an event at 20.26.
What is your recollection of thisA.
So I think at this point in time, as I documented and is
in my statement, I was just about finishing what I was
doing with the third baby.
was unsuccessful.

Then:
> Q.So you have told the jury that you had at least
attempted to put a long line into the third baby.
What
was it from your recollection that drew your attention
then away from the third baby towards [Baby A]?
A.
So I was called by nursing staff to see him because
he was having these pauses in his breathing.
So I was
asked to go and see him based on that happening.

Bennion:
>Q.Thank you.
Again, where were you when you first became aware
that there was a problem with [Baby A]?
A.
So from reading my statements, I was next to -- in the
same room as [Baby A] but I was next to [Baby B], probably
because the babies were HDU/ITU requirement, so a little
bit more intensive, I would have probably have still
been doing my checks, checking [Baby B] over, checking her
heart rate, breathing, completing my observations and
just making sure that all my safety checks were
fulfilled.
Q.
Mrs Bennion, you say "probably", is that based on the
times or based from an actual memory of the events?
A.
I do remember being in the room and also that correlateswith the time of the event as well that I would have
been in the room.
I wouldn't have left [Baby B], who
I was designated to be looking after.
