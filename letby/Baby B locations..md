This is a diagram of
the location of various babies, the staff that were
allocated in the context of the neonatal unit itself.
Can you see that clearly, [Nurse A]?
A.Yes.
Q.Thank you.
We can see, in nursery 1, [Baby B].
You, according to this, can you confirm, were the
designated nurse?
A.I was.
Q.And according to you, you had a second, certainly for
part of the shift, a second designated baby in the same
nursery, JE?
A.I hadn't remembered that.
Q.Okay.
If that's the case --
We can see from this that, in nursery 3,
Lucy Letby had two babies allocated, located in
nursery 3?
A.Yes.

Next:
> Q.All right.
Well, you mention an episode.
A.Mm-hm.
Q.Can you tell us, firstly, what time you think that
episode was?
A.Um...
Around half past midnight, maybe just before.
Q.We can look at the note in a minute, but I'd just like
to first of all see what you remember.
Tell us about
what you remember, please, of that incident.
A.
So I remember I was -- I had gloves on, I was drawing
medication up -- I can't tell you which baby it was for.
As we said, there was another baby in the room.
Q.
Where were you?A.
I was standing -- so in the intensive care room, [Baby B]
was at the far end and there's sort of a half wall
across and I was just by there.
I couldn't see [Baby B]
directly but, you know, I was in the room and if
I looked down the wall I could see her.
Q.Why couldn't you see [Baby B] directly?
A.Just because of the half wall --
Q.Were you on the other side then of the half wall?
A.Yes.
Q.All right.
A.Because I was drawing intravenous medication up.
Q.Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Why would you have gloves on?
Sorry, I interrupted you.
You're in
nursery 1, you have told us where you were.
A.Yes.
Q.What happened?
A.[Baby B]'s monitor alarmed and Lucy went to her because
I was in the middle of preparing the drugs.
went to her.
Q.Where had Lucy been?
A.Standing with me checking the medication.
Q.Right.
A.And then Lucy said, "She's apnoeic, she's not
breathing", and asked me to go and help.
Q.Okay.
And did you?
A.Yes.
