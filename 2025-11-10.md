- Didn't do ticks today as didn't want to take it to work as it would seem weird.
- First day at work, bit dull but OK.
	- It seems like it won't be a wild ride like some other places for better or worse.
- Had a casual drink in the evening, don't know how to feel about it, positive or negative:
	- In truth it is a bit of a relapse but I'm just going to not panic about it and get back on the horse. 
- Again good French pattern going.
- Thinking about getting a pattern of early wake up in order to make this new job work even better, we will see if it works out well.
	- Not planning on doing it yet.
- Still want to improve typing, get Letby done. But time is going to be more pressed now, need to be more efficient. 
- Overall though new sleep pattern is a huge win, just getting up in the morning with ease for possibly the first time in my life!
- Had a coffee and a tea today, I suppose it might be too much caffeine but didn't want to be sluggish for first day of work.
- Had a bit of a flap about passport but really was found quickly so don't know what I was fussing about.
- Overall mood is relaxed and productive, I can keep going. 
	- I just really find Letby some huge rabbit hole and time sink, but felt responsible for it so there you go.
	- Most commentators on the case were bad and I can do better really.
