 - Marie and Mike were here today didn't speak to them. Didn't feel like it.
 - Quite a bit of the day wasted thinking about Letby case, no real news just that some documentaries are coming, not really worth talking about. The issue is it engages me so much I just want it over. The ridiculous defensiveness of the state and the bad faith of all the people involved.
 - A lot of time looking at the "Busy Beavers" not sure if this was a waste or not, I get what Turing machines are now clearly but feel more mystified by them than ever.
 - Not in a good mood can't get any food as people are here, blocked the driveway.
