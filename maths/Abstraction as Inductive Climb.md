**Core Insight**:  
Abstraction in mathematics and logic emerges **inductively**, not deductively. It is not a clean derivation from axioms, but a layered, creative response to the limitations and patterns encountered in concrete reasoning.

**0. Physical Manipulation (Pre-formal)**

- Activity: Writing with pen and paper, using language, performing calculations
    
- Description: Informal, embodied, practical reasoning
    
- Note: The real base — what all formalism arises from
    

**1. Symbolic Computation**

- Tools: Turing machines, λ-calculus, simple rule-based systems
    
- Abstraction: Stripping physical computation into step-wise, idealised sequences
    
- Motivation: Capture process independent of medium
    

**2. Formal Syntax & Logic**

- Tools: Formal languages, inference rules, deductive systems
    
- Abstraction: Represent proof as symbolic manipulation
    
- Motivation: Make reasoning mechanical and checkable
    

**3. Semantics & Model Theory**

- Tools: Tarskian truth conditions, Kripke models
    
- Abstraction: Assign meaning to symbols over structured domains
    
- Motivation: Explain what formulas _mean_, not just how they're derived
    

**4. Structural Mathematics**

- Tools: Sets, functions, relations, algebraic structures
    
- Abstraction: Treat domains and transformations as general mathematical objects
    
- Motivation: Build models and explore their properties abstractly
    

**5. Meta-Theory**

- Tools: Provability, completeness, consistency, coding
    
- Abstraction: Theories about theories; proofs as objects
    
- Motivation: Reflect on the limits of formal systems
    

**6. Set Theory / Foundations**

- Tools: ZFC, power sets, cumulative hierarchy, ordinals
    
- Abstraction: A language to describe _all_ mathematical structure
    
- Motivation: Provide a general platform to model everything else
    

**7. Meta-Mathematical Universes**

- Tools: Forcing, large cardinals, independence, inner models
    
- Abstraction: Models _of_ set theory itself; alternate mathematical realities
    
- Motivation: Understand the global space of mathematical possibility

**Key Observation**:

> Each layer arises from _pressure_ in the layer below: gaps, paradoxes, unformalised phenomena.

Abstraction is **not** a top-down design — it is a **climb**, inductively made. Once formalised, each level seems deductive in retrospect, but its emergence was driven by inductive generalisation and creative synthesis.

To secure the closure properties of each new level, we are often compelled to introduce seemingly strange or unintuitive entities. If we were to exclude them — for example, by banning non-halting functions, or disallowing large cardinals — the abstraction would become incoherent or incomplete. The "weird ones" are not optional extras; they are the natural consequences of demanding closure, generality, and internal coherence within a formal system.

At each layer there "mapping" isn't perfect it's not like an injective function.

**Philosophical Consequence**:

- You cannot formalise the act of abstraction _as it occurs_, because it involves building the tools that don’t yet exist.
    
- Attempting to do so leads to regress or bootstrapping from within an insufficient system.
    
- Abstraction is therefore **manifest**, not deductively defined.
    

> "Abstraction isn’t constructed from axioms. It’s excavated from experience."
