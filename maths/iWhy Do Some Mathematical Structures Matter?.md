The Landscape of Axioms

Mathematics could, in principle, study any collection of axioms defining how some operation or relation behaves. But in practice, only a small subset of these choices lead to deep, interconnected theories.

Most axiom systems fall into one of four zones:

1. Chaos Land: Weak Axioms → Just Enumeration

When axioms are too weak, they don’t constrain possibilities enough. The result is endless combinatorial catalogs rather than rich theorems.

Examples:

Finite topologies (just counting possible collections of open sets).

Latin squares, magic squares.

General quasigroups without further laws.

Outcome: clever puzzles, but no theory.

2. Rigid Axioms → Deep Theory

When axioms are strong enough, they create self-reinforcing structure: definitions generate theorems, theorems interlock into classifications, and the subject links to other areas of maths and science.

2a. Core & Motivated

These are axioms that connect to cognitively basic ideas (number, space, symmetry) or to physics.

Groups (symmetry, finite simple group classification, physics).

Rings & fields (arithmetic, number theory, cryptography).

Vector spaces (geometry, linear algebra, data, physics).

Manifolds, differential geometry (general relativity, string theory).

PDEs with physical meaning (Navier–Stokes, Schrödinger).

Outcome: This is the “mainstream island” of mathematics — where the Millennium Problems live.

2b. Structured Curiosities

Strong axioms, so some theory exists, but no deep tie to number/space/physics.

Moufang loops (non-associative, tied to octonions but niche).

Jordan algebras (non-associative algebras from early quantum mechanics).

BCK-algebras, Hopf quasigroups.

Outcome: internally rich, but peripheral.

3. Dead Ends: Arbitrary, Unmotivated Axioms

One can always invent exotic laws like
((ab)c)d=(a(bc))d+a(b(cd)),

and ask if anything satisfies them. Usually the answer is trivial (nothing / one gadget) or collapses into case-checking.

Outcome: neither theory nor motivation.

Why Nobody Explains This

Mathematicians live in Zone 2a. They just pick up the “fruitful axioms” and move on, without contrasting them to the unfruitful ones.

Pedagogy avoids negatives. Teachers don’t say “most axiom systems go nowhere,” they just present the good ones.

Field loyalty. Every subfield wants to justify itself, not map itself against the whole terrain.

The Real Answer to "Why Maths Matters"

Because out of the chaos of possible axioms, a few simple and motivated principles — number, space, symmetry, physics — produce rich, interconnected theories.

That’s why the central problems of modern maths (Riemann Hypothesis, Navier–Stokes, P vs NP, Hodge, BSD) all live in Zone 2a, not in combinatorial catalogs or arbitrary axiom-systems.

Summary

Zone 1 (weak) → chaos, enumeration.

Zone 2a (rigid + core) → mainstream maths, physics, prestige.

Zone 2b (rigid but niche) → structured curiosities.

Zone 3 (weird axioms) → dead ends.

Mathematics thrives because a tiny island of fruitful axioms sits in a vast ocean of unfruitful ones — and it’s here, on this island, that we find the structures that explain numbers, space, and the physical world.
