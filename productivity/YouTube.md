## Context

[[YouTube]] is a video-first platform optimised for engagement/entertainment, not learning efficiency.

## Key points

- Great for entertainment and casual exploration.
- Low information density vs text/books/courses.
- Linear format resists skimming, lookup, and active recall.

## Efficient use cases

- Visual/procedural tasks (UI, workflows, physical processes).
- Quick orientation / intuition on unfamiliar topics.
- Targeted clarification of a single, well-defined question.

## Where alternatives are better

- Deep understanding, systematic study, long-term retention (e.g. [[Anki]]).
- Precise language, formulas, dense arguments.
- Fast lookup, comparison, repeated reference.

## Conclusion

Treat as supplementary. For serious learning, text-based or interactive alternatives are usually more efficient.
