## What's Gone Wrong

The internet still looks functional — but in practice:

- Google results are filled with SEO-choked content
- Most "answers" are AI-regurgitated summaries of other summaries
- Depth is rare, subtlety is discouraged, and originality is buried

> "Google still works technically — but what it shows you is often just plausible noise."

## The Subtle Decay

- Pages say _something_ but rarely say _anything new_
- There's more advice, but less understanding
- There are more lists, but fewer arguments
- Everything is optimised for engagement, not thought

## Why This Matters for a Vault

Your note system isn’t just about remembering.  
It’s about rebuilding a space where:

- Ideas are allowed to stay complex
- Questions aren’t flattened into answers
- You trust _your own synthesis_ over algorithmic consensus

## PKM vs Internet (Library vs Compounding)

The internet is excellent for discovery and one-off answers, but it does not compound for you.

- Internet: external/shared memory; optimised for retrieval; context disappears after consumption.
- PKM: personal/cumulative memory; optimised for retention + synthesis; value grows via connection over time.

PKM starts as a memory aid but becomes a thinking aid (long-term working memory): it preserves nuance, intermediate thoughts, and evolving interpretations.

## How PKM Sharpens Ideas Over Time

- Prevents decay (capture before ideas fade/flatten).
- Forces clarification (writing exposes vagueness).
- Enables iteration (revisiting refines and connects ideas).

## Your Vault Is:

- A place to think clearly without clickbait pressure
- A way to return to hard ideas when the web forgets them
- A record of what actually shaped you, not what ranked first

> "You can’t google your way to clarity anymore. You have to build it yourself."

## Bottom Line
If the internet is now too shallow to trust for deep work, your vault becomes not just a tool — but a **necessity**.

## What To Capture (Vs What Not To)

Write down what won’t be easily retrievable later:

- Your heuristics, stances, and personal “rules of thumb” (e.g. [[YouTube]]).
- Information that is genuinely hard to look up again (buried docs, edge-case behaviour, hard-won procedures).

Avoid spending effort recording Wikipedia-style neutral facts that are easy to re-find.

## When PKM Is Overkill

- One-off lookups with no intent to revisit.
- Pure consumption without output, synthesis, or reuse.

Curiosity is still valid: if you want it to compound, capture a one-line takeaway (or a stance/heuristic); if not, let it pass without guilt.
