## Goal

Get the perspective/insight benefits of AI chat without getting stuck in the rabbit hole.

## Default rule

Write the question in [[Questions]] *before* opening chat.

## Workflow

### 1) Pre-chat (60 seconds)

- Write one question as a bullet in [[Questions]].
- Add:
  - Why I asked:
  - What I wanted to decide/do:

### 2) Timebox (10–15 minutes)

- Set a timer *before* starting.
- Keep one thread only.
- If a tangent appears: add it as a new bullet in [[Questions]] (don’t follow it now).

### 3) Exit ritual (required)

End every session by asking for an “exit summary”:

- 5 bullets (key points)
- 1 recommendation (if applicable)
- 3 concrete next checks/steps

If it can’t give concrete checks/steps, stop anyway.

### 4) Capture (optional but recommended)

- Dump the chat into `rough_notes/` and tag `#ai-written` (usually also `#draft`).
- Keep the capture mostly verbatim; don’t curate while tired.

### 5) Close the loop (5 minutes)

- Do the first “next check/step” immediately.
- If you won’t do it now, put it back into [[Questions]] as a `#todo` (and move on).

## Notes

- This is a workflow for controlling *attention*, not maximising idea volume.
- For software comparisons, insist on “how to verify quickly” steps; otherwise you get plausible-but-not-decisive prose.
