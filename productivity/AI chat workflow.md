## Goal

Get the perspective/insight benefits of AI chat without getting stuck in the rabbit hole.

## Default rule

Write the question in [[Questions]] *before* opening chat.

## Workflow

### 1) Pre-chat (60 seconds)

- Write one question as a bullet in [[Questions]].
- Optionally add a line of “why I care” (enough to recover intent later).

### 2) Timebox (10–15 minutes)

- Set a timer *before* starting.
- Keep one thread only.
- If a tangent appears: add it as a new bullet in [[Questions]] (don’t follow it now).

### 3) Exit ritual (required)

End every session by asking for an “exit summary”:

- 5 bullets (key points)
- 1 recommendation (if applicable)
- 3 concrete checks/experiments (how to verify, what to try, what to read)

If it can’t give concrete checks/experiments, stop anyway.

### 4) Capture (optional but recommended)

- Dump the chat into `rough_notes/` and tag `#ai-written` (usually also `#draft`).
- Keep the capture mostly verbatim; don’t curate while tired.

### 5) Re-ground (optional)

- Append a one-line “→ takeaway” to the question in [[Questions]] (so it survives memory decay).
- Optionally do one tiny real-world iteration (a command, a quick test, open the official docs).
- Then stop. The goal is to leave with a stable takeaway, not an expanding tree of threads.

## Notes

- This is a workflow for controlling *attention*, not maximising idea volume.
- For software comparisons, insist on “how to verify quickly” steps; otherwise you get plausible-but-not-decisive prose.
- Backlog policy: do **not** go back and sort/curate old chats in bulk. Only extract/curate opportunistically when the same question comes up again in live work.
- Curiosity is allowed. If you don’t want a session to evaporate in a week, make it leave one durable trace: a question in [[Questions]] plus a one-line “→ takeaway” (and optionally a rough capture).
