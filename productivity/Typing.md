Typing speed has diminishing returns for knowledge work once it no longer interrupts thinking.

## Key insights

- There is no true “speed of thought”; cognition is the bottleneck.
    
- Diminishing returns usually begin around 80 to 100 wpm.
    
- Benefits vary by task; transcription rewards speed, writing and coding do not.
    
- Snippets have fixed overhead; small boilerplate is often faster to type.
    
- Accuracy and spelling improve flow more than additional speed.
    

## Open questions

- Personal breakpoint for snippet versus direct typing.
    
- Impact of layout choice on accuracy gains.
    

## Next actions

- Stop speed training after comfortable touch typing.
    
- Train accuracy and spelling.
    
- Keep snippets only when they encode structure.
