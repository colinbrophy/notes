Typing speed has diminishing returns for knowledge work once it no longer interrupts thinking.

## Key insights

- There is no true “speed of thought”; cognition is the bottleneck.
- Diminishing returns usually begin around 80 to 100 wpm.
- Benefits vary by task; transcription rewards speed, writing and coding do not.
- Snippets have fixed overhead; small boilerplate is often faster to type.
- Accuracy and spelling improve flow more than additional speed.
