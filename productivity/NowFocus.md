Primary:
- [[Project – Letby]]
  Curate, analyse, and produce concrete outputs.
  Treat this as a bounded campaign.
  Avoid perfectionism.

Secondary (non-negotiable maintenance):
- DevOps re-entry
  Rebuild situational awareness after career break.
  Focus on what has changed and what is now commonly expected in day-to-day work.

  Tools to become operationally fluent with:
  - [[Neovim]]
  - MCP
  - Claude Code
  - Bash / shell (aim for comfort and speed, not cleverness)
  - [[Anki]] (for memorising commands, workflows, and terminology)

  Mode:
  - Memorisation through repetition and use
  - Shallow breadth, frequent exposure
  - No deep system-building or taxonomy

Everything else is intentionally dormant. Although now it's the new system, I do feel some better understanding of [[Obsidian]] is needed, just read the official docs, no more.
