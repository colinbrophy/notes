# Evergreen skills for AI-assisted coding

Model UX changes fast. The durable wins come from narrowing the interface and making wrongness cheap to detect.

## Learn (durable)

- Editing + navigation: [[Neovim]]
- Stable interfaces: [[UNIX]], `git`/diffs, tests, logs
- Verification habits: insist on concrete checks (not vibes)
- Judgement: “know what good looks like” (see [[Tacit knowledge]])

## Don’t focus (ephemeral)

- Prompt incantations / tool-specific rituals
- Chasing model leaderboards / tool churn
- Agent frameworks unless repeated ROI
- Delegating invariants (security/concurrency/money) to vibes
- Over-optimising input speed (see [[Typing]])
