- Went to see Edwin today, went to the park in bolton, it was quite nice.
- More Letby stuff see Reddit.
- Using the golf timer to help me repress the urge to keep checking Reddit, painful at first but will get there.
- Still drinking too much, first step is to kill the Reddit urge.
- Still feel unhappy at large, will talk to mum about this.
- Managed to get Anki under control again.
