- 8 ticks today
- Thought about the GABA drink but decided it's just for emergencies, so not for today.
- Finished Baby C reading, will write about it tomorrow.
- Spend a lot of the day faffing on YouTube looking at drug stories. 
	- I did some stuff so no disaster really but clearly quite unproductive while going through this sleep thing.
- Need to write about Baby C
- Really hope this sleep restriction works.
- But the good news is still did welness stuff, went to gym, mediated. Mind is calm.
	- Overall quite happy, this is really good frankly I really feel like I always land on my feet.
