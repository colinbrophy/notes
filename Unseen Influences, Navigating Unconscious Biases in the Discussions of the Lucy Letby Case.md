As we sail look at the Lucy Letby case, let's have an honest chat about unconscious cognitive biases. Straight off the bat - I lead towards a 'Doubter.' But bear in mind, this bifurcation into 'Guilters' and 'Doubters' is merely a loose framework, acknowledging that many shades of belief and skepticism (or undecided stances) exist among us. This isn’t a battleground, but a space for self-reflection and awareness about our internal, often unconscious, biases.

It’s crucial to underline: biases are unconscious and not a tool to refute someone's stance or to use as a weapon in debate. Rather, pinpointing these biases serves as a mirror for us to recognise our latent predispositions and navigate conversations with conscious awareness.

**Clustering Illusion:**

Guilters: Might overinterpret the cluster of infant deaths during Letby's shifts as being too improbable to be due to chance, ignoring that random distribution can create clusters.

**Illusory Correlation:**

Guilters: May perceive a strong connection between Letby’s presence and the infants' deaths, even without direct evidence, believing correlation equals causation.

Doubters: Might associate the lack of a "smoking gun" with the possibility of innocence, presuming only indirect circumstantial evidence always results in erroneous conviction.

**Insensitivity to Sample Size:**

Guilters: Might not factor in the small sample size of incidents (only those occurring during Letby’s shifts) and derive broad conclusions about her guilt.

**Availability Heuristic:**

Guilters:

* Frequent media coverage highlighting the deaths and Letby’s trial might make the connection between her and the deaths overly accessible and believable in their minds.
* Engagement with true crime type content make bias toward explanations that involve foul play.

◦ Doubters:

* High-profile cases of miscarriages of justice and police misconduct, which often get media attention, might be readily recalled, influencing their skepticism about the justice system.
* May have had bad experiences with the justice system or been involved in activism about miscarriages in the past, leading them to believe this is more common that it actually is.

**Confirmation Bias:** Tend to accept and not question the evidence that confirms their belief in Letby's guilt/innocence while ignoring or dismissing countering evidence (I have seen plenty of this on both sides).

**Overconfidence Effect:**

Doubters: Could be overly confident in their ability to discern flaws in the case or perceive alternative explanations, especially as they did not attend the full trial themselves and are rarely experts in the relevant fields.

**Base Rate Fallacy:**

Guilters: Might disregard the statistical rarity of serial killers, particularly among healthcare workers, and overestimate the probability of Letby being one.

Doubter: Might disregard the statistical fact that a supermajority of convictions are correct and them being overturned is rare.

**Agent Detection Bias:**

Guilters: Could assume that the pattern of deaths must have been caused by an intentional agent, i.e., Letby, rather than arising from random or systemic factors.

Doubter: May lead them to overestimate the chances of the police, doctors and prosecution ‘stitching up’ someone.

**Gender Bias:**

Guilters: Might unconsciously harbor biases about women, especially nurses, being “angels of mercy” or "angels of death," affecting their perception of guilt.

Doubters: May believe women, especially in caregiving roles, are less capable of such acts, influencing a bias towards innocence.

**Just-world Fallacy:**

Guilters: Could believe that justice is always served correctly, so if Letby is convicted, she must be guilty.

Doubter: Could believe that justice is always served correctly, so if Letby is wrongly convited she will eventually be released.

**Hindsight Bias:**

Guilters: Can believe that they "knew it all along” that Letby was guilty, based on the presented evidences and narrative, which solidifies their stance.

**Wishful Thinking:**

Doubters: Might hope for a world where such grim acts by caregivers are not possible, thus questioning the verdict that challenges this desire.

**Proportionality Bias:**

Guilters: May instinctively feel that the tragic and significant outcome - the death of infants - must be caused by an equally direct and tangible factor, such as a malevolent actor, because the severity of the consequence (multiple infant deaths) seeks a directly proportional cause.

Doubters: Might lean into the idea that a tragedy of this magnitude, with multiple fatalities, must be the result of a large-scale failure, such as a widespread infectious disease outbreak or systemic incompetency within the hospital.

**Authority Bias:**

Guilters: Could put excessive weight on the expert medical opinions and judicial outcome, viewing authorities as mostly infallible.

Doubters: May be too blindly trusting in sources that they find reliable and not questioning them more.

**Groupthink:**

\-**Dunning–Kruger Effect:**

Guilters/Doubters: Individuals in both groups might overestimate their capacity to interpret the complexities of medical and legal details, erroneously thinking they understand the case better than they do.

**Sunk Cost Fallacy:**

Guilters/Doubters: Having invested emotional and cognitive energy into believing in the guilt/doubt might continue to do so even when presented with contrary viewpoints, to validate their initial investment.

**Narrative Fallacy:**

Guilters: May create a coherent story that links Letby with the tragic events, making the story of her being a serial killer especially compelling and internally consistent, even if it oversimplifies or overlooks anomalous details.

Doubters: Might form an alternative narrative where Letby is a scapegoat, a victim of circumstantial evidence, and systemic failures. This narrative might be compelling in its own right, underscoring themes of injustice and redemption.

**Anchoring Bias:**

Guilters: May anchor onto the first pieces of incriminating information they heard and evaluate all subsequent data in light of that initial impression.

Doubters: If initial information or opinions they encountered were sceptical of the case, they might evaluate all subsequent data with scepticism.

**Outcome Bias:**

Guilters: May judge the decision-making process as good simply because the outcome (conviction) aligns with their belief in guilt.

Doubters: Might deem the entire process as flawed if the outcome contradicts their belief about the inherent fairness or rationality of such processes.

**Blind-spot Bias:**

Guilters/Doubters: Both groups might recognize biases in others but fail to recognize their own biases in evaluating the case.

**Social Desirability Bias:**

Guilters: Might adhere to or express a belief in Letby’s guilt because it may be perceived as aligning with a socially empathetic position toward the infant victims, positioning themselves as defenders of the vulnerable.

Doubters: Conversely, might adhere to or vocalize scepticism about the verdict to align themselves with a perception of being rational, independent thinking, and against potential miscarriages of justice and demonstrating empathy towards Letby.

**Halo Effect:**

Guilters: May perceive one negative aspect or act (for example taking home notes) to bleed into their overall perception of Letby, viewing her in a generally negative light, which can amplify their readiness to believe other negative information about her.

Doubters: Conversely, if they hold a positive view of Letby in one aspect (perhaps perceiving her as a dedicated, attractive nurse), that positive halo may spill over into other perceptions, potentially leading them to discount negative information and afford more weight to positive aspects or doubts regarding her guilt.

**Fundamental Attribution Error:**

Guilters: May attribute the negative events (i.e., the deaths and collapses of infants) to Letby’s personal disposition while potentially overlooking situational factors that might have contributed.

**Self-Handicapping:**

Guilters/Doubters: Might create barriers or excuses for why the opposing viewpoint might be flawed or invalid, safeguarding their ego from having to confront the possibility that their belief could be incorrect.

**False Consensus Effect:**

Guilters/Doubters: Could overestimate the extent to which other people agree with them, leading to an exaggerated sense of validation or feeling of being on the "right side."

**Backfire Effect:**

Guilters/Doubters: Encountering evidence that counters their existing beliefs might not lead them to adjust their views but instead can entrench them further.

**Affiliation Bias:**

Guilters: May prioritize and value the opinions and findings of prosecution expert medical witnesses due to an affiliation or trust in medical professionals and their expertise in their respective fields, particularly given the highly specialised knowledge required to understand and interpret medical events. This trust may lead them to dismiss or undervalue alternative perspectives, such as those presented by statisticians or scientists.

Doubters: May affiliate more strongly with statisticians and scientists who question the methodologies and findings of the medical experts. They may feel an alliance with these professionals due to a shared scepticism or value for rigorous scientific methodology and statistical analysis, possibly perceiving them as more objective or critical in their evaluations. This might lead them to undervalue or dismiss findings presented by medical professionals with decades of experience.



Unraveling the threads of these biases doesn’t simplify the complex tapestry of the Letby case but adds more dimensions to our understanding and discussions. Your additional insights on overlooked or underexplored biases are invaluable – let’s build this narrative collectively.

As we weave through these discussions, let’s be mindful of our silent biases, engaging with empathy, respect, and keen objectivity even when the undercurrents of unconscious biases attempt to subtly steer our course.
