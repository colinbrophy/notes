# **High-Leverage Subjects — Compact, Transferable, Worth Studying Deeply**

These fields yield general reasoning tools and apply across domains.
Low memorisation load, high conceptual return.

## **Humanities / Philosophy**

* Philosophy (core concepts, arguments, distinctions)
* Logic (formal and informal)
* Ethics
* Political philosophy
* Epistemology
* Philosophy of mind, language, science (at a conceptual level)

## **Formal / Quantitative**

* Mathematics (core structures, not techniques)
* Probability & statistics
* Information theory
* Game theory
* Decision theory
* Computer science fundamentals (algorithms, data structures, complexity)

## **Social Sciences**

* Economics (micro, incentives, markets, public choice)
* Psychology (cognitive, developmental, social)
* Evolutionary anthropology
* Sociology at the systems-level (institutions, norms)

## **General Reasoning Frameworks**

* Systems theory
* Negotiation theory
* Contract law principles
* Institutional design
* Critical thinking
* Argument analysis
* **Cognitive science basics** (memory, attention, biases, learning theory)
* **Forecasting & modelling** (Bayesian reasoning, causal models)
* **Rhetoric & writing** (clarity, structure, persuasion)
* **Political & institutional literacy** (incentives, legitimacy, governance)
* **Technology literacy** (how networks, security, scaling, automation behave)

**Summary:**
Small conceptual footprint, high reuse.

# **Worth Studying, Not Memorising — Narrative, Pattern, Context**

These enrich your worldview, but isolated facts are low value.

## **History**

* Ancient, medieval, modern
* National histories
* Military history
* Economic & intellectual history
* **Biographies of major thinkers & leaders**
* **Macrosocial theorists** (Weber, Durkheim, Marx, Tocqueville)

## **Literature**

* Reading primary texts
* Literary theory basics
* Narrative structures

## **Religion & Myth**

* Comparative religion
* Mythological patterns
* Folklore

## **Philosophy (historical development)**

* Traditions and movements, but not dates or biographical facts

## **Arts**

* Film studies
* Music history
* Visual arts
* Cultural studies
* **Cultural anthropology (narrative style)**

**Summary:**
Absorb the *gist* and *patterns*, not the catalogue of facts.

# **Low-Leverage Subjects for Non-Professionals — Detail Heavy, Poor Transfer**

These fields require vast domain-specific detail and provide little general cognitive leverage unless you practise them professionally.

## **Medicine & Health Sciences**

* Internal medicine
* Surgery
* Neurology, cardiology, oncology
* Pharmacology
* Pathology
* Radiology
  Only general physiology & first-aid concepts transfer.

## **Biology (detailed domains)**

* Anatomy
* Taxonomy
* Zoology subfields
* Botany subfields
* Microbiology specialisations
* Parasitology
  Good for specialists, low leverage for generalists.

## **Earth & Space Sciences (detail level)**

* Mineralogy
* Stratigraphy
* Petrology
* Sedimentology
* Glaciology
* Planetary geology
  Concepts travel; details do not.

## **Chemistry (detailed branches)**

* Organic reaction classes
* Analytical methods
* Spectroscopy types
* Inorganic categories
  Too much detail for little everyday value.

## **Law (specialised domains)**

* Tax law
* Environmental law
* Maritime law
* Procedural law
  Contract principles transfer; the rest does not.

## **Engineering Subfields**

* Polymer engineering
* Petroleum engineering
* Structural engineering
* Nanotech engineering
* Materials science details
  High expertise needed, low general transfer.

## **Niche Social Science & Area Studies**

* Area studies (Sinology, Balkan studies, etc)
* Hyper-specialised sociology (sociology of film, food, cyberspace, etc)
* Anthropological microfields
* **Technical arts & media workflows** (cinematography pipelines, sound engineering)
* **Business microdomains** (HR compliance, insurance regulation)
* **Military technical specialisms** (weapons systems, naval architecture)

**Summary:**
Huge memorisation burden, minimal general payoff.

# **Meta Rule**

**High leverage:** concepts that compress experience into reusable models.
**Medium leverage:** narratives that shape intuition.
**Low leverage:** detail-heavy domains with little abstraction.
