### Context

Selecting a single, evidence-based book to guide principle-led note-taking applicable to Obsidian or any other tool.

### Conclusion

**How to Take Smart Notes** by Sönke Ahrens is the best choice.

### Rationale

- Grounded in the real Zettelkasten practice of Niklas Luhmann.
    
- Explains why linking, atomic notes and writing-driven notes work.
    
- Low fluff, clear arguments, transferable across tools.
    

### Non-Choices

- _Building a Second Brain_: useful frameworks, weaker evidence base.
    
- _The Organized Mind_: solid science, less directly applicable to note systems.
