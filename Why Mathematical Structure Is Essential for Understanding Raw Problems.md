Raw mathematical systems like Turing machines and Diophantine equations already encode massive complexity and universality. They can represent any computable function, undecidable problem, or intricate behavior. However, without abstract structures (like number theory, topology, logic, or geometry), we lack the tools to:

* Classify problems meaningfully
* See patterns or similarities
* Generalise results
* Transfer insights across domains

Even though the complexity is "already there," it is functionally invisible without a structured lens. The challenge is not that these problems lack depth, but that they are overwhelmingly rich and undifferentiated without a framework for compression and comparison.

Mathematical abstractions (e.g., manifolds, groups, categories, type systems) are not arbitrary constructs layered on top of reality; they are the tools that make the raw universe of problems intelligible. They allow us to carve the space of all possible problems into:

* Recognisable classes
* Transferable forms
* General principles

Structure is not decorative. It is essential. Without it, even the most interesting undecidable or universal problems reduce to noise. We cannot do mathematics merely by accumulating examples. To *see* and *work with* the problem landscape, we must invent or apply structure.

In this sense, mathematics is not the study of objects, but the study of the *relationships and patterns* that make those objects visible and meaningful.
