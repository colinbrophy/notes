## Why Build a Vault? To Protect What’s Rare

The _core reason_ to keep a personal knowledge system isn’t to store general knowledge —  
It’s to **protect the insights that would otherwise vanish**:

- Those “aha” moments that genuinely shift your view
    
- The connections between ideas that no source links together
    
- The reframings that made something finally make sense
    

Wikipedia, ChatGPT, and textbooks give you the _obvious_. Your vault is there to ensure you never lose the _non-obvious_.

## What’s at Risk

Without a system:

- You keep rediscovering the same ideas without building on them
    
- You forget the angles that actually made something matter to you
    
- You get drowned in safe, canonical explanations
    

## What Your Vault Should Capture

- Connections that surprised you
    
- Analogies that reframed a problem
    
- Realisations that shifted how you see a concept
    
- Synthesis across domains that won’t exist in a textbook

## Practical Rule

Only write it down if it made you think.  
Only link it if it sparked a shift.  
Only keep it if you’ll want to build on it later.

This isn’t a reference archive. It’s an **insight net.**
