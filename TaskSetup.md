# Task System Reset – Summary

## Core Insight

The problem was not lack of productivity, discipline, or tools.

The problem was **false obligation**:
- Curiosity, ideas, learning domains, habits, and identity goals were being treated as *tasks*
- A task manager was being used as a life map
- This created constant background pressure, pseudo-productivity, and endless loops

The fix was to **separate obligations from interests**.

---

## Fundamental Rule

**Tasks = obligations you accept**  
**Notes = possibilities you allow**

If something can be skipped forever without real consequence, it is **not a task**.

---

## What Google Tasks Is For

Google Tasks is used only for:
- Finite, concrete obligations
- Things with real-world consequences
- Things that can be completed and deleted

It is **not** for:
- Ideas
- Learning
- Habits
- Self-improvement
- Identity work
- Projects that require thinking and exploration

---

## Final Google Tasks Structure

### Inbox
- Temporary capture only
- Can include ideas
- Nothing becomes a task unless explicitly promoted
- Must be processed to one of the below or deleted

### High Priority
Meaning:
> “If this doesn’t get done soon, something real breaks or I’m embarrassed.”

Examples:
- Appointments
- Deadlines
- Time-bound admin
- Social or external commitments

### Low Priority
Meaning:
> “I have committed to this, but timing does not matter.”

Rules:
- Still real commitments
- Still finite
- Not ideas or aspirations

### Pending
- Only blocked tasks
- Waiting on people or external events
- Should usually be empty

---

## What Was Removed from Tasks (and Why)

Removed entirely:
- Reading lists
- Learning domains (Maths, Philosophy, Programming, etc.)
- Self-improvement lists
- Habit systems
- Meta-productivity
- “Figure out…”
- “Improve…”
- Identity goals
- “Low priority” idea dumps

Reason:
These are **exploration**, not execution.
Checkboxes turn curiosity into debt.

## Where Ideas Live Now

### Obsidian
Used for:
- Interests
- Ideas
- Learning topics
- Self-improvement possibilities
- “Not sure I want to do”
- Optional experiments

Rules:
- No obligation
- No review schedule
- No checklists
- Allowed to be messy
- Allowed to be ignored forever

Suggested note name:
- `InterestingIdeas`
- or `Interests (not tasks)`

---

## Key Behavioural Rules

- Capture ideas freely in Inbox
- Promotion to a task requires an explicit decision
- If an idea never becomes a task, that is fine
- Infinite domains must never appear as tasks
- Only bounded slices may become tasks

Test:
> “If I never do this, will something real break?”

If no → it is not a task.

---

## Maintenance & Tooling

- Maintenance is boxed and boring
- Tool optimisation (including Obsidian) is **not a standing task**
- Only fix tooling when there is **real pain**
- Fix one specific issue, then stop

---

## End State

The system is intentionally:
- Small
- Boring
- Practical
- Under-ambitious

This is a feature, not a bug.

If the system ever feels heavy, moral, or like a measure of worth, the boundary has been violated.

---

## Final Principle to Remember

> Curiosity should feel light.  
> Obligation should feel heavy.

If curiosity feels heavy, the container is wrong.
