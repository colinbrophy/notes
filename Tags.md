# Tags

Tags are for **properties and states** of notes (not what the note *is*). Use them for cross-cutting filters and workflow.

## Workflow

- `#todo`: actionable tasks/checklists to work through.
- `#open-questions`: unresolved questions or uncertainties worth revisiting.
- `#draft`: incomplete write-up that needs shaping.

## Note types

- `#index`: navigation / map-of-content notes (lists of links).
- `#source`: primarily sourced material (quotes, transcripts, extracts).
- `#quote`: contains substantial quoted text (usually with context).

## Storage

- `#archive`: imported/backlog material kept for reference but not maintained.
