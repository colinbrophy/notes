> **A.** From what I remember, yes.
> **Q.** Do you recall, please, where [Baby C] was situated in the unit when you came on duty? 
> **A.** Yes. In nursery 1, the left-hand side, towards the sink, the bottom space, the intensive care space.
> **Q.** We've seen some video footage of the unit and room 1 certainly has two doors right and left. Does that help you orientate you where he was?  
> **A.** The left-hand side.
> **Q.** Okay. Do you recall whether there were any other babies in room 1 on that morning?

## Sophie Ellis
> **Q.** We'll go to a document in a moment, but do you remember who you were allocated that particular evening?  
> **A.** I was allocated to look after [Baby C].
> **Q.** And where was [Baby C]?  
> **A.** In nursery 1.
> **Q.** Do you recall whether there were any other babies in nursery 1?  
> **A.** There was, but I couldn't remember who.
> **Q.** Okay. Were you looking after [Baby C] on your own?  
> **A.** I was, but because I was junior at that time, I was being supported by one of the band 6s.
> **Q.** And who was that?  
> **A.** Mel Taylor.

Next:
> **Q.** Now, when you came on duty do you recall whereabouts [Baby C] was in the nursery?  
> **A.** Yes. He was directly in front of the entrance, or one of the entrances, into nursery 1. I don't know what bed space it was.
> **Q.** Do you remember which of the two entrances it was?  
> **A.** It was the one closest to the nurses' station.
> **Q.** You're indicating to the left.  
> **A.** Yes.
> **Q.** So as you look at nursery 1, don't worry, we've seen there are two doors by way of entrance. You say he was opposite the door on the left?  
> **A.** Yes.
> **Q.** That's your recollection? All right.
