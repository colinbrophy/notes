# Tacit knowledge

You can often *evaluate* and *label* (“good/bad/risky”) without being able to fully *specify the rule* that produces the judgement.

- Our awareness of what we want is partial: we can name a few salient constraints, but the acceptability function stays implicit (“I’ll know it when I see it”).
- This makes examples/labels easy and complete specs hard (edge cases + tradeoffs + invariants must be made explicit).
- Natural language helps during search (keep degrees of freedom open); formal systems help as nonsense filters (early rejection).
