## 1. Canonical Truth (Internal)

* **Question**: What properties hold in a fixed, canonical structure?
* **Mode**: Work inside one object (integers, reals, zeta, Navier–Stokes, etc.) once it is defined in a background theory.
* **Examples**:

  * Riemann Hypothesis: are all nontrivial zeros of ζ on the line?
  * Navier–Stokes: do smooth global solutions exist?
  * Prime Number Theorem: asymptotic distribution of primes.
* **Meta-level**: *minimal* — only enough background to define the structure, then the reasoning is internal.

## 2. Existence / Uniqueness (Meta)

* **Question**: Do structures with given axioms exist? Are they unique up to isomorphism?
* **Mode**: Step outside a single object; quantify over possible models.
* **Examples**:

  * Poincaré Conjecture: uniqueness of simply connected closed 3-manifolds (the 3-sphere).
  * Exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$: does it exist?
  * Hilbert’s 10th: does an algorithm exist to decide Diophantine equations? (Answer: no.)
* **Meta-level**: *medium* — you are no longer just inside one structure, but reasoning about what the axioms allow.

## 3. Maps / Correspondences (Cross-world)

* **Question**: Do invariants from two independently defined worlds line up?
* **Mode**: Compare different categories/structures via functors to a common codomain.
* **Examples**:

  * Langlands: automorphic forms (Hecke eigenvalues) ↔ Galois reps (Frobenius traces).
  * Hodge Conjecture: Hodge classes ↔ algebraic cycles.
  * BSD: order of vanishing of L-function ↔ rank of elliptic curve.
  * P vs NP: verifiable polytime ↔ constructible polytime.
* **Meta-level**: *heavy* — requires a meta-framework (category theory, functoriality) to even state the comparison.

## The Hierarchy of Meta-levels

* **Level 0**: Canonical truth — internal, minimal meta.
* **Level 1**: Existence/uniqueness — meta about models.
* **Level 2**: Maps/correspondences — cross-world meta, functorial comparisons.

## Historical Arc

* Up to \~1800: almost all mathematics was (1) canonical truth (Euclid, Euler, Gauss).
* 19th century: rise of (2) existence/uniqueness (non-Euclidean geometry, pathological functions, classification of groups/surfaces).
* 20th century onward: dominance of (3) maps/correspondences (Riemann surfaces, reciprocity laws, Langlands, categorical bridges).

## Summary

Mathematics seems to crystallise into **three modes of enquiry**:

1. **Canonical truth** — prove what’s true inside the canonical structure.
2. **Existence/uniqueness** — determine if structures with given axioms exist, and if they are unique.
3. **Maps/correspondences** — explain why invariants from different worlds coincide.

These are the **three ways of maths**: internal theorems, meta-structural questions, and cross-world bridges.
