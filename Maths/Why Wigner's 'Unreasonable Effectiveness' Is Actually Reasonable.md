Wigner famously described the success of mathematics in describing the physical world as an "unreasonable effectiveness". This phrase captures a profound and legitimate sense of awe: the abstract creations of human thought not only describe reality but often predict it with astonishing precision.

However, on reflection, this success may not be unreasonable at all. In fact, it may be the most reasonable outcome, given the world we inhabit.

If the world around us is stable, predictable, and law-governed, then it *must* have deep structure. The very possibility of science, engineering, and reliable experience implies that the microstructure of reality behaves coherently. Wild or chaotic laws at the base level would likely manifest in erratic or incoherent behaviour at higher levels. The absence of such chaos suggests not a miraculous coincidence, but deep mathematical regularity.

Furthermore, the idea that mathematical laws continue to hold when we extend our observations—into deep space, high energies, or quantum regimes—is not a shock. It is precisely what one would expect from a universe governed by general principles rather than local quirks. What would be truly surprising (and disturbing) is a universe that appeared orderly at human scale but became incoherent or self-contradictory when pushed.

Indeed, if the base level of reality were governed by wildly complex, baroque rules — each particle having its own bizarre sub-laws or behavioural exceptions — we should expect those irregularities to "leak upward" into the macroscopic world. The very fact that they don't would imply an extraordinary act of fine-tuned suppression. It would mean the universe is somehow conspiring to *hide* its complexity, presenting an illusion of simplicity. That kind of conspiracy would be far less plausible than genuine simplicity.

It also fits our broader expectations: the more interactions and combinations a system allows, the more complex it becomes. So it is not surprising that the smallest-scale structures—those with the fewest interacting parts—are governed by the most elegant and constrained laws. This is not only expected, but necessary, if higher-level behaviours are to be stable and intelligible at all.

And the use of mathematics in physics is not some inexplicable coincidence either. Mathematics evolved in tandem with our need to understand the world. It is a system for identifying elegant compressions and abstractions — precisely the kind of tool needed to describe a world governed by law and regularity. That science makes use of it is no more surprising than that we use language to describe our surroundings. Both emerged as cognitive tools shaped by the structure of reality itself.

Thus, the fact that the lower layers of reality are more elegant and constrained than higher-level phenomena isn't evidence of a miracle. It is what you would predict if the universe is lawful at all. If instead there were secret complexity at the base—arbitrary rules, exceptions, or local bureaucracies—we would expect that messiness to "leak upward" and undermine the regularities we observe.

The awe Wigner described is still deeply legitimate. It's not diminished by this reinterpretation—if anything, it's deepened. That mathematical structure can describe reality so well is awe-inspiring *not because it's improbable*, but because it reveals the kind of world we live in: one where abstraction, pattern, and generality are built into the foundations. That is its own kind of miracle, and its own kind of beauty.
