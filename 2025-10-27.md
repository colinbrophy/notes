- Got job offer back they are happy need to fill out some more forms. I supposed is the best route back after a career break.
- Didn't sleep much was tired and heartburn possibly lack of sleep related.

- 9 ticks of the watch, included drink and urges to lie in bed this time.
	- Strictly no causal drinks or bed outside sleep
- Mediation again but tired so didn't get that far.
- No gym today but that's OK sleep deprivation quite bad on purpose.
- Sleep restriction plan to reset relationship with bed is the idea.
	- I think fixing sleep is key as otherwise alcohol looks tempting forever.
- Spent quite a bit of time thinking about drugs, that's fine and all thinking about what relationship to have with them.
	- Esseniely none unless initiated by others.
	- Anything harder than alcohol is just a no go, for below then maybe if other initiated. But otherwise not bother.
