- Ok day started to actually get back into french due to spare time.
- Went to the pub with mum, really drinking is still a lie I feel like. It's never as good as you think it will be.
- I then had a cheeky extra at home, shouldn't do that really it breaks the rules.
- 0 ticks though.
- Missed out on the gym though
