-  Wrote the Baby A post for Letby sub, it went well.  It will shake things this series, it shows the utter chaos of the case. Hopefully but the case in untenable when you lay it out plainly.
- Quitting evening causal drinking is going well, I still think about it but I really belive that these feelings will go away in a few weeks. This has haunted me for years. I need to come to terms with the fact you should just feel negative emotions, there is no reason to run away from them.
- Went to the gym It felt great actually went hard for a change don't know what got in to me.
- Phone call with new company, they won't offer any more money so it's a pay cut but might take it anyway. One to consider really.
- Did a bit of french.
- Probably should have had more of a schedule though today as still feel like didn't get that much done.
