## Cost Is King → Low Maintenance

- “Cleanup” tends to be a **percentage of what you have** (you prune ~N% of old/big/low‑value stuff), not a perfectly optimised list.
- Cheaper storage means you can delete a *smaller %* and still get comfortably below your cost “pain threshold” → less total data to triage/delete, and longer until the next cleanup cycle.
  - Example: “delete ~20%” is ~1TB at 5TB, but ~500GB at 2.5TB.
- This is one reason I prefer low $/TB providers (e.g. [[Hetzner]] Storage Box).
