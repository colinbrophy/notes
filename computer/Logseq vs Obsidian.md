## Core difference
The fundamental difference is **what is first-class**.

- [[Logseq]]: blocks have stable IDs
- [[Obsidian]]: files/pages are the primary unit

Everything else follows from this architectural choice.

## Comparison

### Structure
- Logseq: implicit, emerges via blocks and indentation
- Obsidian: explicit, chosen via files, folders, and headings

### Refactoring
- Logseq: move blocks without breaking references
- Obsidian: refactor by cutting and pasting between files

### Capture
- Logseq: daily notes are central and unavoidable
- Obsidian: daily notes are optional

### Long-form writing
- Logseq: supported but outline-oriented
- Obsidian: more natural and document-focused

### Portability
- Logseq: plain Markdown, but block semantics are tool-specific
- Obsidian: plain Markdown with minimal extra semantics

### Migration
- Obsidian → Logseq: easy
- Logseq → Obsidian: harder if block IDs and queries are core

## Longevity considerations
For PKM expected to last decades:
- Simple formats age better
- Fewer implicit semantics reduce risk
- Conservative design favours portability

## Conclusion
- Choose [[Logseq]] for idea capture and emergent structure
- Choose [[Obsidian]] for durability, portability, and document-centric thinking

The final decision prioritised **long-term stability and exit cost**, favouring Obsidian.
