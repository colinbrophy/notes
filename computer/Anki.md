- Great for learning:
	- Languages
	- Really underrated in programming learning, a lot of atomic rules to memorise.
- Need to suspend really long interval cards, as they waste time:
	- Either you don't need it as it never comes up or you get natural reps from the real world.
		- For programming around 6 months seems good.
		- For human languages maybe 5 years as reinforcement can be uneven here.
	- You can turn off suspend if for whatever reason you know you aren't going to be doing practice for a while.
	- Probably good to tag so we can do this.
	- [[Personal Knowledge Management]] ([[Obsidian]]) can serve as a good alternative a lot of the time, especially programming.

### DON'T FORGET - Memory is a scarce resource
