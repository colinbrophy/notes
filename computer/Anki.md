- Great for learning:
	- Languages
	- Really underrated in programming learning, a lot of atomic rules to memorise.
- Need to suspend really long interval cards, as they waste time:
	- Either you don't need it as it never comes up or you get natural reps from the real world.
		- For programming around 6 months seems good.
		- For human languages maybe 5 years as reinforcement can be uneven here.
	- You can turn off suspend if for whatever reason you know you aren't going to be doing practice for a while.
	- Probably good to tag so we can do this.
	- [[Personal Knowledge Management]] ([[Obsidian]]) can serve as a good alternative a lot of the time, especially programming.

- Maintenance math (rule of thumb):
	- If you have 10,000 mature cards averaging ~5 years between reviews, that’s ~10,000 / 1,825 ≈ 5.5 reviews/day.
	- At ~5 seconds/review, that’s ~27 seconds/day of steady-state maintenance.
	- Assumes a stable deck (no new cards), no lapses, and evenly distributed due dates; real pain usually comes from front-loaded learning, lapses, and short-interval spikes.
	- So you can maintain a lot of mature cards; no need to panic.
	- I often press `Easy` once cards are in the ~1–4 year range: if you don’t get any natural reps in that time, it probably wasn’t worth memorising.
		- Tradeoff: you’ll miss some rare-but-important items (false negatives), so only do this if you’re consciously separating “critical” vs “ambient” knowledge.
	- Rarely is lookup actually impossible; memory is mostly for speed/fluency (and reducing cognitive friction), not access.
		- If lookup latency meaningfully disrupts work, it’s worth stabilising in Anki; otherwise letting it fade is fine.
