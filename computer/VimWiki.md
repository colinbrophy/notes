**VimWiki** is a Vim plugin for maintaining a personal wiki using plain text files.

## Essence

- File-based, editor-native, zero indexing.
    
- Links are explicit; structure is manual.
    
- No global state, no semantic model.
    

## Strengths

- Very fast.
    
- Durable plain text.
    
- Fully keyboard-driven.
    
- Easy to understand and debug.
    

## Limits

- No backlinks index.
    
- No metadata or queries.
    
- No dynamic views or recomputation.
    

### A cool project idea:

Make an indexer service for VimWiki, then you can get the benefits of Obsidian but no annoying electron app.
- [[Rust]] sounds like the ideal language choice here.
## Mental model

_A text editor with links, not a knowledge system._
