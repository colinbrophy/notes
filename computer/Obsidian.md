## What it is
[[Obsidian]] is a local-first personal knowledge management tool built on plain Markdown files.  
Its primary abstraction is the **note as a document**, stored in folders on disk.

## First-class concepts
- Files/pages as the main unit
- Bidirectional links between pages
- Folder-based organisation
- Plugin-driven extensibility

## Strengths
- Excellent long-term portability
- Plain Markdown readable without Obsidian
- Large and active plugin ecosystem
- Strong for long-form writing and documentation
- Scales well to very large vaults

## Trade-offs
- Blocks are not first-class objects
- Refactoring often involves moving text between files
- Advanced workflows depend on plugins
- Structure must be chosen rather than emerging automatically

## Best suited for
- Long-term PKM (decades)
- Document-centric thinking
- Users who value optionality and low lock-in
- Writing-heavy workflows
