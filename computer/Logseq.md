## What it is
[[Logseq]] is a local-first, open-source PKM tool built around **block-based outlining**.  
Every block of text has a stable identity and can be referenced independently.

## First-class concepts
- Blocks with stable IDs
- Daily notes (journals) as default entry point
- Tasks as blocks with state
- Queries over blocks
- Implicit structure via indentation

## Strengths
- Capture-first, structure-later workflow
- Cheap refactoring without rewriting
- Ideas are atomic and reusable
- Built-in task management
- Strong native PDF annotation support

## Trade-offs
- Block-centric model is opinionated
- Queries and block IDs are tool-specific
- Migration out is higher-friction if heavily used
- Younger ecosystem and less proven longevity

## Best suited for
- Rapid idea capture
- Fragmented or outline-based thinking
- Users who want structure to emerge over time
- Task- and journal-driven workflows
