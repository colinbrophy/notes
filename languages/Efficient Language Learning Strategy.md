# ⚡ Efficient Language Learning Strategy (SRS + Input)

## 🎯 Main Goal

> Unlock native audio comprehension (95%+ known vocab), so you can guzzle native content freely.  
> Everything else — reading, speaking, grammar — follows naturally.

---

## 🧠 1. Vocabulary Is the Bottleneck

- You can't understand native audio without knowing most of the words.
    
- Listening becomes effective after you've built a large passive vocabulary.
    
- Prioritise fast vocab growth early.
    

---

## 🧾 2. Start with Word Cards (Briefly)

- Use **word-front Anki cards** for the first **500–1000 high-frequency words**.
    
- This avoids cognitive overload from parsing full sentences too early.
    

---

## 🧩 3. Switch Quickly to Sentence-Front 1T Cards

- Use sentences where **only one word is unknown** (`1T = one target`).
    
- Sentence cards provide:
    
    - Context
        
    - Grammar
        
    - Disambiguation
        
- Word cards become inefficient due to interference and vague recall.

## 🔁 4. Mine Efficiently

- Don’t pause immersion to make flashcards.
    
- Instead:
    
    1. Watch or read native content.
        
    2. Mark unknown words (e.g. star, highlight, or log them).
        
    3. Batch mine the **best 5–10 per day**.
        
- Use tools like:
    
    - Subs2SRS / Subs2cia
        
    - Yomichan
        
    - Language Reactor
        
    - Migaku
        

---

## ⛔ 5. Avoid Faff

- Keep card formats minimalist.
    
- No over-formatting or perfectionism.
    
- Don’t overspecify or oversupplement every card.
    
- Delete weak or unnecessary cards regularly.
    

---

## 🎧 6. Delay Audio Cards

- Audio cards early on:
    
    - Slow vocab growth
        
    - Limit mining speed
        
    - Are too context-heavy
        
- Use audio cards **later**, after you've unlocked native audio.

## 🚀 7. Phase Strategy

|Phase|Focus|
|---|---|
|0–500 words|Word-front cards (core vocab)|
|500–1,000 words|Begin sentence-front cards|
|1,000–3,000 words|Sentence-front 1T cards only|
|Post 3,000 vocab|Hammer native audio immersion|
|After audio unlock|_(Optional)_ Audio cards|

---

## 🎬 8. Use Subtitles, Then Wean Off

- Start with **target-language subtitles** to:
    
    - Train parsing and pronunciation
        
    - Anchor spelling to sound
        
    - Reinforce grammar and vocab
        
- Gradually wean off:
    
    - First pass with subs, rewatch without
        
    - Transition to audio-only as comprehension improves
        
- > Subtitles are a **ramp**, not a **crutch**
    

---

## 🛡️ Philosophy: Anki Is the Gatekeeper

> Anki is a tool to unlock real input.  
> Don’t learn like a child — learn like a hacker.  
> Get to **95%+ comprehension** in real input as fast as possible. Then guzzle.

---

## ✅ Summary

- Use **word cards briefly** to bootstrap.
    
- Switch to **sentence-front cards** for scale.
    
- **Mine after immersion**, not during.
    
- **Delay audio cards** until listening is strong.
    
- **Use subs early**, then wean off to train real comprehension.
    

### Ultimate Goal:

> **Unlock native listening → Consume native media massively → Everything else follows**
