**Publishers with consistent quality:**

- **O'Reilly** — the animal books. Variable quality now (they publish a lot), but the classics are classics. Look for older titles that are still in print — longevity signals quality.
- **Addison-Wesley** — the Professional Computing series. Stevens, Kernighan, the serious stuff. Academic rigor but readable.
- **No Starch Press** — practical, well-edited, respects the reader. "How Linux Works", "The Linux Command Line", "Absolute FreeBSD". Less academic, more "here's how to actually do things."
- **Pearson** — owns Addison-Wesley, also does academic CS texts. Tanenbaum's books are Pearson.
- **MIT Press** — foundational CS theory, SICP lives here.
- **Pragmatic Programmers** — developer-focused, strong on craft. More software than infrastructure.

**Authors who don't waste your time:**

- **W. Richard Stevens** — TCP/IP, Unix programming. Deceased, but his books remain definitive.
- **Brian Kernighan** — co-wrote K&R C, writes with exceptional clarity.
- **Andrew Tanenbaum** — OS and networking textbooks, pedagogically solid.
- **Michael Kerrisk** — "The Linux Programming Interface", exhaustive and precise.
- **Evi Nemeth** — sysadmin handbook, practical and comprehensive.
- **Tom Limoncelli** — ops practice and philosophy.
- **Martin Kleppmann** — "Designing Data-Intensive Applications", modern classic.

**Heuristic:** If the book has been in print for 10+ years and people still recommend it, it's probably worth your time.
