You don’t connect thinkers just to compare — you do it to **see the patterns**.

- These patterns help you **build a model of how the world works** — how ideas arise, clash, and evolve in different conditions.
- They also help you **remember**. Connections anchor ideas in context, making them easier to store and retrieve meaningfully.
- Without connections, ideas float. With them, they form a structure — and that structure is what you’re really learning.
- **Context matters**: Noticing which ideas thrive under which conditions (e.g. during crises, revolutions, imperialism) helps prevent presentist thinking.

> The point isn’t to collect ideas — it’s to see how they fit together, and what that reveals about the world.
