- Starting to feel a less tired than before hope this is the end of my sleep epic journey. It does suggest it's working the tiredness is in decline. The issue is I'm a bit scared the sleepiness won't come this time due to lack of fatigue.
- Didn't do much today, annoyed the gym was shut and it rained so no cycling.
- Had the Gaba drink, not much to say really doesn't have much effect.
- 6 ticks today not bad.
- Finished all A&B text.
- really need to write baby c post, but really been procrastinating this one. It just seemed too much on the sleep deprivation situation. Hopefully will be normal again soon.
- good news is all other habits are on track.
- might get back into immersion soon. The point is coming.
- Got a lot a littl niggling tasks done like obsidian sync, just paid for it as lazy option for now.
- also spent quite a bit of time on nootrripics,. The only ones worthwhile are creatine, caffeine and nicotine.
- for caffeine I plan to go cold turkey the. Only do 3 times a week. My current process builds too much tolerance.
- Nicotine, bit scary but maybe the occasional gum is a good idea we will see.
