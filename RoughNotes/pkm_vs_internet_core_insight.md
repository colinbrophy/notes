# PKM vs the Internet

## Core Question
What is the point of Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) compared to simply relying on the internet?

## Short Answer
The internet provides access to information. PKM turns information into durable, evolving knowledge.

## Key Distinctions

### Internet
- External, shared memory
- Optimised for discovery and one-off answers
- Information is static and non-cumulative
- Loses context once consumption ends

### PKM
- Personal, cumulative system
- Optimised for retention, synthesis, and reuse
- Stores not just facts but interpretations and context
- Gains value over time through connections

## PKM as Memory Aid (and More)
PKM begins as a memory aid but quickly becomes a thinking aid.

It:
- Offloads recall
- Preserves nuance and intermediate thoughts
- Acts as long-term working memory

However, its real value is not recall alone.

## How PKM Sharpens Ideas Over Time

1. **Prevents decay**  
   Ideas are captured before they fade or flatten.

2. **Forces clarification**  
   Writing exposes vagueness and strengthens precision.

3. **Enables iteration**  
   Revisiting notes allows refinement, correction, and deeper connections.

Over time, ideas become clearer, better supported, and more useful.

## Core Mental Model
- Internet = Library
- PKM = Second brain / extended cognition

## When PKM Is Overkill
- One-off lookups
- No intent to revisit or synthesise
- Pure consumption without output

## Conclusion
PKM ensures ideas compound rather than disappear. It turns thinking from perishable to cumulative.
