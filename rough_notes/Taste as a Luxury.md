Key insights or conclusions
Taste is framed as a luxury that emerges only after escaping precarity. Early-stage behaviour optimises for speed, reach, and legibility rather than coherence or refinement.
Artistic maturity is described as managing an ongoing tension between control and surrender, not a one-way move toward authenticity.
Loneliness is reframed as a condition of agency rather than dysfunction: being alone enables ownership of narrative and intent.
Much surrounding detail is ephemeral; the durable value lies in these abstracted models of development and agency.

Open questions or uncertainties
Is “taste as a luxury” broadly applicable across non-creative domains such as technology, academia, or career building?
At what point does optimisation for mass appeal begin to constrain rather than enable later coherence?
Is chosen solitude genuinely empowering, or partly a post-hoc rationalisation of isolation?

Next actions or follow-ups
Compare this framing with similar claims in career development or startup literature.
Test the “taste as a luxury” idea against counterexamples where refinement precedes stability.
