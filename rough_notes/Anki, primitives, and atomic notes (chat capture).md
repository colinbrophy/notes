## Context / goal

Capture a discussion thread about Anki/spaced repetition as an “efficient learning” tool, the role of memorising primitives for conceptual recall, and why atomic notes help retrieval/reuse.

## Key points

- “Anki is the most efficient learning” is defensible for long-term retention of discrete, testable facts, but overstated outside that scope.
- Anki works best when encoding well-chosen primitives (definitions, minimal examples, boundary cases, contrasts) rather than surface conclusions.
- Card design is “simple but unforgiving”: stable rules exist, but common failure modes recur under time pressure.
- Atomic notes reduce retrieval ambiguity, enable recombination, expose gaps, scale better, and align with active recall/spaced repetition.

## Cleanup targets

- [[Anki]]
- [[spaced repetition]]
- [[active recall]]
- [[primitives]]
- [[card design]]
- [[atomic notes]]

## Chat (verbatim)

Anki seems to be the most efficient learning in the
world.
The statement is broadly defensible but overstated.
Anki is among the most efficient tools for long-term retention of discrete, testable
facts because it implements spaced repetition and active recall, both of which are
well supported by cognitive science. For vocabulary, medical facts, technical
commands, formulas, dates, and similar material, Anki often outperforms rereading,
highlighting, or passive review in terms of time invested versus recall achieved.
Its efficiency drops outside that scope. Anki is weak for skill acquisition, conceptual
synthesis, creative work, and problem solving beyond pattern recognition. It also
imposes overhead: card design quality matters, poorly written cards reduce
effectiveness, and motivation can become the limiting factor. Efficiency is therefore
conditional on correct usage and subject matter.
A more precise formulation would be: Anki is one of the most efficient tools
available for memorising factual knowledge over long time horizons.
This would fit well in a high-quality Reddit discussion. Consider posting a refined
version to r/Anki or r/learning to get empirical counterexamples and comparisons.
Yes for actual skills.
But once you have memorised the right primatives, the
concepts are normally the easy part to remember.
This is largely correct, with an important constraint.
For many domains, especially technical ones, concepts compress dramatically once
the underlying primitives are available in memory. When symbols, definitions,
commands, patterns, and canonical examples are already fluent, higher-level
concepts tend to be remembered through inference rather than rote recall. In that
sense, memorisation reduces cognitive load to the point where “understanding”
becomes cheap.

Memorisation and Conceptual Memory
This is most visible in mathematics, programming, languages, and medicine. Experts
appear to remember concepts easily, but what they actually have is dense, well-
indexed primitive knowledge that allows rapid reconstruction. Anki works well at
building that substrate.
The constraint is that primitives must be well-chosen. If you memorise surface facts
instead of generative building blocks, you get brittle knowledge that does not
support concept formation. Card design matters here: definitions, minimal examples,
boundary cases, and contrasts are far more valuable than isolated facts.
So a sharper claim would be: once the correct primitives are automatised,
conceptual memory is largely a by-product of reasoning, not storage. Anki is
effective insofar as it is used to encode those primitives rather than conclusions.
This would be a good fit for a focused discussion on r/Anki or r/cogsci, where
people will challenge what counts as a “primitive” and where the boundary breaks
down.
I actually think card design isn't hard.
That is a defensible position, but it depends on what “hard” is being contrasted with.
Card design is not intellectually hard in the sense of requiring deep theory. For most
domains, good cards follow a small number of stable rules: atomicity, clear cues,
unambiguous answers, and alignment with how the knowledge is used. Once those
rules are internalised, producing adequate cards is routine.
What is hard is resisting common failure modes. People tend to overpack cards,
memorise conclusions instead of generators, or write prompts that do not match
real recall conditions. These are not difficult to understand mistakes, but they are
easy to make repeatedly, especially under time pressure.
So the disagreement often comes down to perspective. For disciplined users with a
clear model of their domain, card design is straightforward and quickly becomes
mechanical. For novices, or for ill-structured subjects, it feels hard because the
underlying knowledge is not yet decomposed into stable primitives.
A concise way to frame it: card design is simple, but it is unforgiving.

Memorisation and Conceptual Memory
Why do notes need to be atomic?
Notes need to be atomic because memory, reasoning, and reuse all operate on
small, well-defined units. Atomicity is not an aesthetic preference; it follows from
how cognition and retrieval work.
First, atomic notes reduce retrieval ambiguity. When a note expresses one idea, any
future reference to it has a single interpretation. Multi-idea notes force you to reread
and re-parse, which increases friction and failure at recall time.
Second, atomic notes support recombination. Complex understanding is built by
assembling primitives in different contexts. If ideas are bundled together, they
cannot be independently reused, linked, or challenged. Atomic notes behave like
Lego bricks; non-atomic notes behave like glued sculptures.
Third, atomicity exposes gaps and errors. When you try to isolate a single claim or
concept, vagueness becomes obvious. Notes that feel “complete” often hide
unresolved confusion because multiple ideas prop each other up.
Fourth, atomic notes scale better over time. As a knowledge base grows, large notes
become dumping grounds that decay. Small notes remain stable, searchable, and
linkable, even years later.
Finally, atomicity aligns with spaced repetition and active recall. A note that maps to
a single question can be tested, revised, or discarded cleanly. Non-atomic notes
cannot be meaningfully recalled without rereading.
In short, atomic notes minimise cognitive load, maximise reuse, and force clarity.
Any system that optimises for long-term thinking rather than short-term
summarisation converges on this structure.
