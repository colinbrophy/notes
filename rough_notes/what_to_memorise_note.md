# What to Memorise, What to Study, and What to Ignore  
A practical rule for intellectual life.

## Core Principles  
- Memory is expensive; treat it as a scarce resource.  
- Understanding comes from **exposure, variation, and narrative**, not raw fact retention.  
- Use [[Anki]] for **atomic, high‑leverage recall items**, not for deep concepts or rich subjects.  
- Read widely, but memorise selectively.  
- Ignore isolated facts that offer no conceptual or practical payoff.

## 1. Topics Worth Memorising (High Leverage)

### Reasoning Tools  
- Necessary vs sufficient conditions  
- Inductive vs deductive reasoning  
- Validity vs soundness  
- Bayesian intuition  
- Core cognitive biases (confirmation, availability, anchoring)

### Philosophical Anchors  
- Analytic vs synthetic  
- A priori vs a posteriori  
- Deontology vs consequentialism  
- Substance vs property dualism  
- Compatibilism vs incompatibilism

### Technical Daily Knowledge  
- Essential [[UNIX]] flags (grep -r, rsync -av, tar -xzvf)  
- Git operations you forget (rebase options, reset modes)  
- Kubernetes basics (Deployment vs StatefulSet, probes, Services vs Ingress)  
- Regex syntax  
- Standard library tools you use constantly  
- Keyboard shortcuts that improve flow

### High-Level Frameworks  
- OSI layers  
- TCP handshake  
- HTTP request lifecycle  
- Major historical periods  
- Classical logic rules  
- Foundational concepts (entropy, opportunity cost, expected value)

### Language Learning Essentials  
- High-frequency vocabulary  
- Grammar patterns  
- Irregular verbs  
- Idioms  
- Short example sentences

## 2. Topics Worth Studying but NOT Memorising (High Understanding, Low Recall Value)

### History  
- Detailed chronologies  
- Lists of emperors or rulers  
- Minor battles and dates  
- Detailed succession charts  
- Specific political events  
Why: understanding comes from narrative immersion and pattern recognition, not fact recall.

### Philosophy  
- Long arguments in full  
- Interpretive nuance  
- Subtle criticisms  
- Dense primary-text detail  
Why: value lies in *learning how to think*, not storing propositions.

### Literature  
- Plot minutiae  
- Character lists  
- Detailed symbols  
Why: the point is emotional and conceptual enrichment.

### Science as Narrative  
- Stories of discovery  
- Research timelines  
- Historical development of theories  
Why: these build intuition but have no fact-level leverage.

### Social and Political Dynamics  
- Institutional behaviour patterns  
- Cultural change  
- Sociological analysis  
Why: these require deep exposure, not memorisation.

- Capital cities  
- Populations  
- Mountain heights  
- River lengths  
- Airport codes

- Full lists of rulers  
- Exact dates of obscure wars  
- Minor treaties and dynastic transitions

### Scientific Trivia  
- Melting points  
- Atomic weights  
- Mineral composition percentages  
- Animal gestation periods  
- Taxonomy lists

### Astronomy Trivia  
- Number of planetary moons  
- Names of nebulae  
- Star classifications  
- Orbital periods of minor bodies

### Cultural Trivia  
- Oscar winners  
- Chart-topping songs  
- Sports statistics  
- Fictional universe lore

### Technical Trivia  
- Niche flags  
- Full APIs of large libraries  
- Rare HTTP codes  
- Version-specific behaviour

## Why These Topics Are Low Leverage  
- They build no transferable skill.  
- They create no conceptual insights.  
- They decay fast without use.  
- They improve nothing in reasoning or performance.  
- Forgetting them has no consequence.

---

## Grand Summary  
**Memorise what enhances thinking or daily work.**  
**Study what enriches understanding.**  
**Ignore what provides no leverage.**

This is the practical rule:  
- Use [[Anki]] for *fast recall of core concepts and tools*.  
- Use books, podcasts and philosophy for *deep models and intuition*.  
- Let isolated facts die. They were never valuable.
