## Context / goal

Capture of a transcript-style snippet about making your work visible by aiming at “expensive pain” (career/product-market-fit framing), attributed in-text to Steve Quinn (“Uncle Steve”).

## Key points

- Hard work can be invisible if it solves problems you care about, not problems others care about.
- Think “product-market fit” for your career: skills (product) + company/team pain (market).
- Do “market research” with your boss: ask about frustrations and constraints, not “am I doing well?”
- Look for “expensive pain” and translate technical pain into business impact.
- Build the “value loop”: solve for one → generalize into a reusable system → announce/share so it gets adopted.
- Notice your “too easy” strengths: problems you’re drawn to, what energizes you, compliments you brush off.

## Cleanup targets

- [[Product-market fit]]
- [[Career development]]
- [[Performance reviews]]
- [[Visibility (work)]]
- [[The Mom Test]]
- [[CI/CD]]

## Chat (verbatim)

What if I told you that all of the hard
work that you're doing might be
completely invisible to the people that
decide your career? Not because you're
doing bad work, but because you're doing
the wrong work. Wouldn't you like to
know which is which? You show up every
day. You do what's asked of you. You're
responsive, reliable, and you hit your
deadlines, and yet somehow other people
are getting promoted while you're stuck
in place. Your manager says you're doing
good work, but that never translates
into high performance reviews, raises,
recognition, or the interesting projects
that you actually want. Here's what I
learned after 20 years in the industry.
Working harder at the same things
doesn't move the needle. It's like
throwing darts at a board with perfect
consistency, hitting the same spot over
and over again, except for you're
completely missing the bullseye. Nobody
cares how hard you work if you're
hitting the wrong target. They only care
about the value you create and the
difference between those two things.
That's what this video is about. My name
is Steve Quinn, but you can call me
Uncle Steve. I spent nearly two decades
at Amazon, where I rose to the rank of
principal engineer, and I watched
incredibly talented, hardworking people
plateau while others seem to glide up
the ladder. For years, I thought it was
politics or luck or who you knew. But
I'm here to tell you, it's not. It's
something much simpler. and I'll break
it down for you in this video. If you

me know that I'm on the right track. If
there's a topic you want me to cover,
drop it in the comments. I read
everyone. Let me paint a picture that
probably feels familiar. You're deep in
the zone. You've just refactored a
gnarly piece of legacy code. It's
cleaner now, much more maintainable, and
easier to test. You spent days on it.
You feel good about the work. You commit
it. You create the PR and nothing. A
couple of approvals, maybe a looks good
to me comment. Then everyone just moves
on. Meanwhile, your co-workers spent an
hour writing a bash script to automate
something manual. And suddenly they're a
hero. People are thanking them in
meetings. Managers are asking, \"Can you
do this for my team, too?\" Or here's
another scenario. You've been grinding.
You're always responsive, always
reliable, and you deliver your work on
time. Performance review season comes
around and you get meets expectations.
Meanwhile, someone who works normal
hours and takes actual vacations got
exceeds and is being considered for
promotion. What's going on here? You're
working hard, but you're aiming at the
wrong target. You're solving problems
you care about, not problems others care
about. You're throwing darts with
perfect consistency, hitting the same
spot over and over again. You're just
completely missing the bullseye. To
understand what's going on, we're going
to use a concept from the startup world,
product market fit. In startups, you can
have killer technology, a team of
geniuses working around the clock, but
if you haven't found a market that
values what you're building, none of it
matters. You're just burning money. Your
career works the same way. You can be
incredibly skilled, working harder than
anybody else, but if your work isn't
solving problems that people care about,
you're going to stay invisible. I just
got back from a YouTube creator
conference in Dallas where I met someone
who made this painfully clear. This guy
was talented, charismatic, and
hardworking. He told me he was a
polymath, a person with extensive
knowledge across many different subjects
who's able to draw from these diverse
areas to solve a wide variety of
problems. At karaoke, he got a standing
ovation from strangers. He absolutely
killed it. Later, he told me that he
created over 5,000 videos over the past
eight years. I thought I was talking to
the next Mr. Beast. But then he showed
me his channel, a couple hundred
subscribers and many, many videos with
singledigit views. How does someone so
gifted and an outlier in both talent and
effort have such a dismal set of
results? Because he had a product, his
content, his skills, his effort, but he
never found a market that valued it. His
videos were him talking about himself
and what he wanted to talk about, but he
never gave his audience a reason to
watch his stuff. The exact same thing
happens at work. The engineers who
succeed aren't necessarily the hardest
workers or the most technically
brilliant. They're the ones who find
product market fit for their work. Think
of yourself as a company of one. You
have a product, your skills, your unique
strengths, your capacity to solve
problems. The market is the expensive,
painful problems your company
desperately needs solved. Most people
spend their careers perfecting their
product, learning new frameworks,
improving their code quality, getting
better at their craft, that's good. You
should do that. But if you never find
the right market for those skills, it
doesn't matter. You're the person with
5,000 videos and nobody watching.
Companies don't hire people because they
like having smart people hanging around.
they hire as a last resort to solve
problems that they can't ignore anymore.
Stop asking, \"What should I learn next?\"
or \"How can I improve my skills?\" Start
asking, \"What expensive pain can I
solve?\" Because once you find that fit,
once you connect your unique abilities
to a real problem that people care
about, suddenly all of that hard work
that you've been doing actually matters.
Your effort becomes visible because it's
aimed at the right target. So, let me
show you exactly how to find that
target. Speaking of making your work
production ready, let me show you
something that's become essential in my
workflow. And it's a perfect example of
solving a real pain point. With AI
coding agents like Claude Code, Cursor
CLI, and Gemini, we're all generating
code faster than ever. But here's the
problem. AI generated code can have
hallucinations, logical errors, and code
smells that slip right past you. You're
moving fast, but are you creating value
or just creating tech debt? That's where
today's sponsor, Code Rabbit CLI, comes
in. It's terminal native AI code review
that catches issues at terminal velocity
before you commit, before the PR, before
it becomes everyone's problem. Here's
what makes it brilliant. It works right
in your command line with whatever AI
coding agent you're already using. You
write code with Claude or cursor. You
run code rabbit review and it gives you
senior engineer level feedback
instantly. It catches hallucinations,
security issues, performance problems,
the stuff that would embarrass you in
code review. And the best part, CLI
reviews are completely free. This is
exactly what we're talking about. It
solves a real pain point. In the AI era,
code generation isn't the frontier
anymore. Code reviews and production
readiness is. Code Rabbit CLI is the
quality gate that makes sure your
velocity actually creates value. Install
it with one command. I'll drop the link
in the description. Trust me, future you
will thank present you. So, how do you
find product market fit? You start with
market research. And your first
customer, your most important customer
is your boss. But here's what most
people get wrong. They ask questions
like, \"Am I doing a good job?\" or \"How's
my performance?\" and they get polite,
useless answers. Yeah, you're doing
great. Keep it up. That's not market
research. That's asking your mom if your
business idea is good. She's going to
say yes because she loves you. There's a
brilliant book called The Mom Test by
Rob Fitzpatrick. The premise is simple.
Stop asking for opinions on your
solution and start asking about your
customers lives to find the real
problems. Apply this to your manager. In
your next one-on-one, ask questions
like, \"What's the most frustrating part
of your week? What's the biggest thing
slowing our team down right now?\"
If you
could wave a magic wand and solve one
problem, what would it be? Listen for
their frustration. The answer to those
questions is your market. Solving that
problem is your product. Let me give you
an example from Amazon. I was once asked
to help a team that was known for buggy
code and moving really, really slow. The
diagnosis was that it was a skills gap.
The plan was to create a training
program to teach them better engineering
practices. But instead of building a
curriculum right away, I spent a week
just watching them work. You know what I
found? There wasn't a skills gap at all.
It was a pain gap. Their process for
releasing software was an absolute
nightmare. A single deployment took days
and involved dozens of manual steps and
approvals. The process was so
heavyweight that teams would batch
changes together, which meant that any
particular release had a high chance of
issues. It became a self-fulfilling
prophecy. These weren't bad engineers.
They were good engineers trapped in a
terrible system. The pain wasn't lack of
skills. The pain was a broken deployment
process that was costing the team two
developer weeks of productivity every
single month. That's expensive pain.
That's the kind of pain that gets
attention and budget. Now, here's the
key. Once you found that expensive
problem, you need to ask yourself a
different question. Not how do I solve
this once, but what skill, if I mastered
it, would solve this class of problem
forever. Your long-term value isn't in a
single solution. It's in your capacity
to solve many problems. You have to
build a tool, and that tool is you. With
that deployment team, my unique skill
wasn't that I knew how to set up
continuous deployment. I did. Half the
engineers on that team probably knew
more about CI/CD pipelines than I did,
but my skill was in translating
technical pain into business impact. I
showed them how to frame the problem not
as our deployment pipeline is complex,
but as we're losing two developer weeks
of productivity per month to this
process, which is delaying our feature
launch by a quarter. I guided them on
what to say at meetings, but then I
stayed silent and forced them to deliver
the message. Suddenly, leadership
understood. The team got the bandwidth
they needed because the pain was
surfaced in terms business leaders
actually care about. This ability came
from a core part of who I am. I believe
in teaching people how to fish, not just
giving them a fish. The most powerful
skills are extensions of your
personality. So, here's how to find your
unique skill. First, what kind of
problems are you naturally drawn to? Are
you the person who loves untangling
legacy code? The one who can debug the
impossible? the one who designs complex
systems or maybe you're the one who
naturally bridges the gap between
engineering and product. Second, what
activity gives you energy while draining
others? Maybe it's refactoring. Maybe
it's mentoring junior engineers. Maybe
it's performance optimization. The thing
that makes others say, \"I don't know how
you have the patience for that.\" is a
clue. Third, and this is huge, what
compliment do you brush off because it
felt too easy? When someone thanks you
for explaining something clearly or
staying calm during an outage, your
instinct might be to say, \"Ah, it was
nothing.\" It wasn't nothing. It was you
using a core skill that feels so
natural, you don't even recognize it as
valuable. The pattern in your answers
points to your most authentic product.
That's the core of your product market
fit. Okay, so you found the expensive
pain. You've identified your unique
skill that can solve it. Now comes the
execution. This is where the magic
happens because there's a huge
difference between being helpful once
and being essential. Let me show you
what I mean. I once spent weeks
refactoring a codebase. I love that type
of work. Cleaning things up, simplifying
the dependency graph, removing
duplication. At the end, the code was
objectively better, more maintainable,
easier to test. But you know what?
Nobody cared. I got a polite nice work
in a code review and everyone moved on.
A few weeks later, I spent maybe 2 hours
writing a simple Python script to
automate a tedious task that our program
management team had to do manually. It
saved them hours every single week.
Suddenly, I was a hero. People were
thanking me in meetings. Other teams
wanted to know if I could do something
similar for them. The difference? One
solved the problem that I cared about.
The other solved a problem they cared
about. So, here's your framework to turn
your solutions into systems. I call it
the value loop. Step one, solve for one.
Find one person with a nagging problem
and apply your unique skills to solve it
completely. Don't try to boil the ocean.
Make one person's life measurably
better. Maybe it's automating a report
your manager creates manually. Maybe
it's fixing a flaky test that's annoying
your team. Whatever it is, deliver a
clear, undeniable win. Step two,
generalize the solution. Take your
one-off solution and turn it into a
reusable tool, template, or documented
process. That Python script, I didn't
just run it for the support team. I
packaged it into an internal website,
made it configurable, added
documentation, and put it in a shared
repo. It went from Steve's script to the
support automation tool. Step three,
announce the product. This is where most
people fail. They solve the problem,
maybe even generalize it, but then they
don't tell anybody. You have to share
it. Post it in a team channel, mention
it in a meeting, write a quick wiki
page, frame it simply. Here's a common
pain. Here's the tool that solves it.
Here's how to use it. This doesn't just
solve one problem. It announces that
you're the person who solves a class of
problem. And that's where the value loop
comes in. More people come to you. You
get a reputation. You get more
opportunities. You get promoted. That
support script. It eventually made its
way into production. Other teams forked
it. It became part of how we operated.
And every time someone used it, they
remember who built it. When time fixes
make you helpful. A repeatable system
makes you essential. The hardest workers
don't always win. The people with the
best skills don't always get promoted.
The ones who succeed are the ones who
find product market fit, who connect
what they can uniquely do with problems
people desperately need solving. Stop
perfecting your product in a vacuum. Go
find your market. Ask about pain, not
performance. Build the skills that solve
expensive problems. Deliver quality
solutions and turn them into systems.
Because once you find that fit, all that
hard work you've been doing, it finally
starts to matter. If you found this
video helpful, I've got another video
that pairs perfectly with this. It's
about how to be a better verbal
communicator. I spent over $10,000 on
learning how to talk better. And I
distilled everything I learned into four
simple steps that anybody can follow.
Take a look. I know that you'll love
