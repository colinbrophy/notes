# Questions

Use this as a “parking lot” for curiosity so questions don’t get lost (or immediately turn into a chat rabbit hole).

## How to use

- Write the question first (before asking an LLM).
- Keep this free-flow (not a todo list).
- Optionally add 1 line of “why I care” and a link to where the answer landed.
- When something is genuinely useful, append a one-line “→ takeaway” so it survives memory decay.

## Questions

- How do I avoid rabbit-hole chats?
  - why: losing hours to “interesting”
  - links: [[productivity/AI chat workflow]]
  - → takeaway: timebox + exit ritual
