# Questions

Use this as a “parking lot” for curiosity so questions don’t get lost (or immediately turn into a chat rabbit hole).

## How to use

- Write the question first (before asking an LLM).
- Add 1–2 lines to preserve intent:
  - Why I asked:
  - What I wanted to decide/do:
- Optional: add a tag from `Tags.md` (e.g. `#open-questions`, `#todo`).
