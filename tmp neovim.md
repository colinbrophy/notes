'wrapmargin' 'wm'	number	(default 0)
			local to buffer
	Number of characters from the right window border where wrapping
	starts.  When typing text beyond this limit, an <EOL> will be inserted
	and inserting continues on the next line.
	Options that add a margin, such as 'number' and 'foldcolumn', cause
	the text width to be further reduced.
	When 'textwidth' is non-zero, this option is not used.
	See also 'formatoptions' and |ins-textwidth|.
