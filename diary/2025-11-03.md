- I just recorded on my task list about "That place in Scotland", I know it refers to that epic house we used to go to. It was a nice place one of my favourites looking back, but there isn't much action to this task so just wanted to write a bit about it.
- Got my task list quite organised today which is good. It looks manageable now.
- Letby transcripts are on hold for now, as we don't have enough.
- Tried to get french up and running again as lacking other activities. Frustrating tech issues.
- Agreed to take job next week hopefully it should all turn out ok. Had an issue with email that should be fixed soon.
- Starting to feel a little more liberated from endless checking.
- Only one cup of coffee today, tapering that off.
- Meditation, cycling, drinking etc all on track.
- Felt a slight sense of boredom today hopefully should start to go.
- Annoyed I seen to have lost the little bit from my mouse but need to look for it.
- I just feel like now I have broken down my task list it doesn't feel insane any more.
- Bought bike lights, after it started to get dark.
- Only 3 ticks today which is good.
