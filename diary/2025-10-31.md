- Decided to order modafinil today, but only use it when sleep deprived and not to deliberately lose sleep.  
- 6 ticks, had this weird surge in urge to drink that went quick.
- Started on Baby C but didn't get that far.
- Went to subway, ate too much food but so got really tired, this kind of derailed the day to some extent from this.
- Didn't really get back on track discrated by modafinil
- Did get to go to the gym though and do all habits so that's a win.
- Maybe will get sleepy at a sensible time we will see. 
- Still of course slilgy sleep deprived but should get fixed soon.
