- 5 ticks.
- Went to see Edwin he was unsettled and wanted to come back home:
	- I feel sorry for him in a way but also he is unable of listening to anyone else so that's what happened.
	- He was becoming unmanageable. 
- Letter from Evans today and did some stuff on the wiki.
- Got CO transcript so will need to go through that one to write the Baby D post.
- Bought a mechanical keyboard, bit pricey hope it's worth it
- More French practice is going well.
- Hammering through the TODO list.
	- Please about this, the concept of just having everything done is epic.
