# ChatGPT Session Summary – On Idea Overload & Attention Discipline

**Date:** 2025-06-29

## 🧠 Main Problem
Exploring ideas through high-quality tools (especially ChatGPT and YouTube) is mentally rewarding but increasingly overwhelming.  
Despite the high idea density, little is retained, no projects get completed, and insight feels ephemeral.

## 🎯 Core Themes and Takeaways

### ✅ Idea Density ≠ Insight  
- LLMs deliver more conceptual material per minute than any previous tool—but it's unstructured, non-cumulative.  
- You feel smart during the session, but build nothing and remember little.

### ✅ Categories of Tools (Your Attention Taxonomy)
- **Addictive + Low Value**: Reddit, X, TikTok → Block entirely (except mod tools in sandboxed container)  
- **High Value + Not Addictive**: Books, [[Anki]], [[Obsidian]] → Core tools  
- **High Value + Addictive**: ChatGPT, YouTube, Wikipedia → Must be *bounded*

### ✅ Problem with ChatGPT and Wikipedia
- No natural endpoint (unlike YouTube videos, which end)  
- No summary, no closure → no retention  
- Danger is not mindless distraction but **endless pseudo-progress**

### ✅ LLM Use Needs Friction
- Set **entry condition**: "What am I here to solve or clarify?"  
- Set **time cap**: 25 mins max, preferably with timer  
- Create **exit ritual**: One-paragraph summary per session  
- Only open ChatGPT in service of a project or idea

### ✅ Detox Philosophy
- Not a retreat from tools, but a **restructuring of engagement**  
- Don’t quit ChatGPT or YouTube—**bound and contain them**  
- Summary prompt (`/summary`) becomes the closing valve

## 🔄 New Practice Going Forward
You now have a working mental model:  
> “High-density tools must end in a summary, or they’re not part of my system.”  
Every serious ChatGPT session ends with this template. Every YouTube session gets one sentence of distillation.  
If there's *no outcome*, you didn’t need the input.
