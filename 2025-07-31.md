- Spent some time thinking about setting up a diary system and here we are! My first entry.
- I wanted to setup a diary as I was saving a lot of system metadata and for some reason thought that would help "save" my life but it really just provides noise so we are doing this instead.
- 18:31 - Experienced a sudden bout of sadness and low energy. Is it to do with the fact I have been getting up early? I don't know. Was on French YouTube but switched to English (pointless and dull, just pointless chess videos and similar)
- 22:34 - The previous mood ended but still feeling in a strange mood.  It feels like now at the age of 30 the basic themes of the world are mapped out, I don't feel any "deep mysteries" like I used to. For example I recall when 18, Set theory and the Problem of induction feel really deep, but they no longer do. 
- Philosophy in particular felt like some vast mystery. It doesn't any more it just feels like scholarship, carefully filling and organising ideas and why people have them.
