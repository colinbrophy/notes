- Spent some time thinking about setting up a diary system and here we are! My first entry.
- I wanted to setup a diary as I was saving a lot of system metadata and for some reason thought that would help "save" my life but it really just provides noise so we are doing this instead.
- 18:31, experienced a sudden bout of sadness and low energy. Is it to do with the fact I have been getting up early? I don't know.
