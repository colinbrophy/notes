# Workflow Strategy Summary

## Core Principles
- Begin with a minimal, modular toolset.
- Let real pain points determine when to add or adjust tools.
- Avoid heavy all-in-one or highly flexible systems early (e.g. Org mode, Notion).
- Build automation only after a stable workflow emerges.
- Keep each tool limited to one clear role.

## Recommended Tool Roles
- **Google Tasks**: Short-term, shallow action items only.
- **Obsidian**: Idea capture, long-term notes, project context. Minimal structure.
- **Loop Habit Tracker**: Simple recurring habits.
- **Calendar**: Fixed commitments and events.
- **ChatGPT**: Scheduling, prioritisation, planning, decomposing tasks.
- **Neovim**: Deep work and execution environment.

## Why Not Heavy Systems
- Flexible tools like Org mode or Notion require a predefined workflow.
- They encourage premature structure and maintenance overhead.
- They risk becoming systems you maintain rather than tools you use.

## The Pain-Driven Approach
1. Use the current minimal stack.
2. Observe friction and treat it as data.
3. Fix only the specific pain point with the smallest possible change.
4. Allow patterns and routines to emerge over time.
5. Add automation only after the workflow stabilises.

## Outcome
- A lightweight, adaptable workflow tailored to actual behaviour.
- Clear separation of thinking, planning, and doing.
- No lock-in, no heavy maintenance, and low cognitive load.
- A long-term system that grows naturally and avoids clunkiness.
